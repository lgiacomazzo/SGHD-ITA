[0]I ended up listening to all of Kurisu’s lecture at ATF.[%p]
[1]After the two time travel theories she introduced at the beginning, she explained the rest with equal eloquence. [%p]
[2]She seemed a little nervous at first, but that quickly changed as she spoke. By the end, it was an impressive lecture. So impressive that you wouldn’t think it was an 18-year-old’s first time.[%p]
[3]She did well to respond to my malicious questions with sarcasm. She’s got guts.[%p]
[4]Wait, why am I praising her!?[%p]
[5]Leaving that aside...[%p]
[6]I saw Makise Kurisu dead.[%p]
[7]And yet she is alive.[%p]
[8]My memories don’t mesh with reality.[%p]
[9]And not just about Kurisu. My conversations with Daru and Mayuri didn’t make sense either.[%p]
[10]Everything would be solved if I just told myself that what I saw was a dream. An illusion. It never happened.[%p]
[11]But never say never.[%p]
[12]...This leaves me with no choice.[%p]
[13]After parting ways with Daru at ATF, I head to Yanabayashi Shrine.[%p]
[14]I need to get exorcised.[%p]
[15]I seriously doubt that the Makise Kurisu at ATF was a ghost. [%p]
[16]Regardless, it’s natural to seek an exorcism after such an experience. I’m Japanese. It’s in our blood.[%p]
[17]Yanabayashi Shrine is located on the other side of Kanda River. To find it, enter the first side road after crossing Manseibashi Bridge. It’s a very small shrine that doesn’t fit with the surrounding multi-tenant buildings.[%p]
[18]Kanda Myojin is the more famous shrine in Akiba, but I deliberately chose this one.[%p]
[19]The shrine is so small, you could easily miss it if you weren’t looking.[%p]
[20]Regardless, I can hear the chirping of cicadas from the few trees growing here.[%p]
[21][name]Mayuri[line]“It’s Okarin! Tutturu♪”[%p]
[22]There are two girls standing in front of the main building.[%p]
[23]One of them is Mayuri.[%p]
[24]The other is a docile-looking beauty in traditional [color index="820000"]miko[color index="800000"] attire.[%p]
[25]Urushibara Luka.[%p]
[26]A stunning example of feminine charm and grace.[%p]
[27]Lips delicate like cherry blossoms in bloom.[%p]
[28]The essence of Japanese beauty.[%p]
[29]The chief priest’s son.[%p]
[30]That’s right, “son”.[%p]
[31]Lovely in every way... but he’s a guy.[%p]
[32][name]Luka[line]“Good afternoon, Okabe-san.”[%p]
[33]He bows his head.[%p]
[34]The voice of a girl. The mannerisms of girl.[%p]
[35]More feminine than any girl I know.[%p]
[36]But he’s a guy.[%p]
[37]Taller than Mayuri. Yet oh so slender.[%p]
[38]But he’s a guy.[%p]
[39]Looks stunning in miko robes.[%p]
[40]But he’s a guy.[%p]
[41]Holding a bamboo broom. Apparently in the middle of cleaning.[%p]
[42]But he’s a guy.[%p]
[43]It’s almost evening, yet still hot as hell outside.[%p]
[44]But he’s a guy.[%p]
[45]Damn cicadas won’t shut up.[%p]
[46]But he’s a guy.[%p]
[47][name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako. That blade I gave you, what happened to it?”[%p]
[48]He’s a friend of mine. I call him Lukako.[%p]
[49]We met when I rescued him from some aggressive photographers in Akiba’s [color index="820000"]Pedestrian Heaven[color index="800000"].[%p]
[50]It also so happens that Lukako and Mayuri are classmates. I learned that fact after I had gotten to know him.[%p]
[51]Lukako is taken aback by my sharp question.[%p]
[52]He starts fidgeting with a flushed face and tears in his eyes.[%p]
[53][name]Luka[line]“Um, you mean... Demon Sword Samidare?”[%p]
[54][name]Rintaro[line]“Correct. I bought it for you so you could learn to control your power.”[%p]
[55][name]Mayuri[line]“Oh yeah! You bought it at [color index="820000"]BladeWorks[color index="800000"], right? I think you said it cost 980--”[%p]
[56][name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t say another word! Any more and [color index="A0140000"]they[color index="800000"] will come to silence you!”[%p]
[57][name]Mayuri[line]“They’re gonna silence me? Thanks for worrying about me, Okarin. But who are they?”[%p]
[58]I ignore Mayuri’s question.[%p]
[59][name]Rintaro[line]“So, Lukako. Are you making sure to practice with Samidare like I told you?”[%p]
[60][name]Luka[line]“Y-yes, I do practice swings once a day...”[%p]
[61][name]Rintaro[line]“As long as you carry it and master the Seishin Zanma school of swordsmanship, you can prevent the dark flame inside you from consuming your soul.”[%p]
[62]Demon Sword Samidare may be an imitation sword, but that is only the form it takes to hide from the world.[%p]
[63]When one worthy to wield it appears, it unleashes its true power.[%p]
[64]And it was on sale for only 980 yen (tax included).[%p]
[65][name]Luka[line]“Thank you, Okabe-san. It was a wonderful present.”[%p]
[66][name]Rintaro[line]“My name isn’t Okabe.”[%p]
[67][name]Mayuri[line]“It’s Okarin!”[%p]
[68][name]Luka[line]“I’m sorry, Kyouma-san.”[%p]
[69][name]Rintaro[line]“As long as you understand. Now, speak the words.”[%p]
[70][name]Luka[line]“Ah, umm. El... Psy... Kongaloo...?”[%p]
[71][name]Rintaro[line]“No! Not Kongaloo! Kongroo!”[%p]
[72][name]Luka[line]“Y-yes!”[%p]
[73][name]Luka[line]“El... Psy... Kongroo.”[%p]
[74][name]Luka[line]“D-did I get it right?”[%p]
[75]Lukako smiles happily as I nod.[%p]
[76][name]Luka[line]“Thank you.”[%p]
[77]Such a lovely smile.[%p]
[78]But he’s a guy.[%p]
[79][name]Mayuri[line]“Such a beautiful master-disciple relationship. Mayushii’s not a [color index="820000"]fujoshi[color index="800000"], but she’s getting a little excited.”[%p]
[80][name]Luka[line]“Ehh!? M-Mayuri-chan, please don’t imagine such things...”[%p]
[81]Geez.[%p]
[82]Though we do have a master-disciple relationship.[%p]
[83]I, Hououin Kyouma, have gone to great lengths to brainwash -- er, I mean teach -- Lukako about the evil conspiracies that rule the world, and how to resist them.[%p]
[84]That stuff about Demon Sword Samidare is part of that training.[%p]
[85]Looks aside, Lukako is very obedient and hardworking. Plus, he’s always eager to learn new things. A master couldn’t ask for a better disciple.[%p]
[86]Though he does have the weaknesses of not catching on too quickly and being too shy.[%p]
[87][name]Rintaro[line]“What are you doing here, Mayuri?”[%p]
[88][name]Mayuri[line]“I came to see Luka-kun.”[%p]
[89][name]Mayuri[line]“[color index="820000"]ComiMa[color index="800000"]’s coming up next month, and I want him to cosplay as [color index="820000"]Kirari-chan[color index="800000"] from RaiNet. But he won’t say yes...”[%p]
[90][name]Luka[line]“But, cosplaying... that’s just too embarrassing for me...”[%p]
[91][name]Mayuri[line]“But I’m sure you’ll look great in it!”[%p]
[92][name]Mayuri[line]“The phrase ’[color index="820000"]someone this cute can’t be a girl[color index="800000"]’ is really popular, you know? C’mon, make your cosplay debut!”[%p]
[93]Mayuri’s hobby is making costumes. She’s made at least thirty so far, but it’s rare for her to wear one herself.[%p]
[94]Instead, she seems to get her kicks from seeing other people wear them.[%p]
[95]And it looks like she’s chosen Lukako as her next target.[%p]
[96]Naturally, the costume Mayuri is currently raving about is for a female character.[%p]
[97]Normally, I would understand why a man wouldn’t want to dress like a girl, but come on. Lukako has no problem wearing miko robes. Why should cosplay be any different? [%p]
[98]But whatever. I have business to take care of.[%p]
[99][name]Rintaro[line]“Save the trivial stuff for later.”[%p]
[100][name]Mayuri[line]“Ehh? But it’s really important to Mayushii.”[%p]
[101][name]Rintaro[line]“And it’s trivial to me!”[%p]
[102][name]Rintaro[line]“Anyway, Lukako. There’s a good reason for my being here today. I need you to perform an exorcism.”[%p]
[103][name]Luka[line]“An exorcism? Then I’ll go get my dad. Please wa--”[%p]
[104][name]Rintaro[line]“No, it’s nothing that serious. I just need some peace of mind.”[%p]
[105]That’s why I came here instead of Kanda Shrine.[%p]
[106][name]Rintaro[line]“So with that said, bring out the usual.”[%p]
[107][name]Luka[line]“Um, the usual? You mean Samidare?”[%p]
[108][name]Rintaro[line]“No! Who the hell uses a demon sword for an exorcism!? The usual for an exorcism should be obvious!”[%p]
[109][name]Luka[line]“Uhh... um...?”[%p]
[110][name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t know what it’s called, but it’s that stick with the zigzaggy paper thingies that the priest does a shaky thingy with!”[%p]
[111][name]Mayuri[line]“Ahaha! That sounded really dumb, Okarin!”[%p]
[112]Quite a shock to hear that from Mayuri.[%p]
[113][name]Luka[line]“Oh, the [color index="820000"]oonusa[color index="800000"]. But, I don’t know if my father will lend it to me...”[%p]
[114][name]Luka[line]“I’ll go ask him.”[%p]
[115]Lukako makes a quick bow, then runs off towards his house, which is on the shrine grounds.[%p]
[116]Meanwhile, Mayuri takes her pocket watch out of her bag to check the time.[%p]
[117]It’s a very old watch, not the sort you’d expect a high school girl to carry.[%p]
[118]Its name is Pockety.[%p]
[119]Obviously that’s the name Mayuri gave it, not its brand name or anything.[%p]
[120]Ever since elementary school, Mayuri has carried Pockety with her everywhere.[%p]
[121]It’s her most important treasure.[%p]
[122][name]Mayuri[line]“Well, time for me to go to work!”[%p]
[123][name]Rintaro[line]“Do your best. You going straight home afterwards?”[%p]
[124][name]Mayuri[line]“Yup.”[%p]
[125]Mayuri lives in Ikebukuro.[%p]
[126]She comes to Akiba by train just about every day.[%p]
[127]It should be obvious since we’re childhood friends and all, but I live in Ikebukuro too.[%p]
[128]Though I’ve been staying at the lab since summer break began.[%p]
[129][name]Mayuri[line]“See you tomorrow!”[%p]
[130]I call Mayuri to stop before she trots off.[%p]
[131][name]Rintaro[line]“Wait, Mayuri. Back at Radi-Kan, you heard a man scream, right?”[%p]
[132][name]Mayuri[line]“Scream?”[%p]
[133]Mayuri blinks several times and puts her finger to her temple as if in thought. Then she gives her usual smile.[%p]
[134][name]Mayuri[line]“When was that again?”[%p]
[135][name]Rintaro[line]“This afternoon.”[%p]
[136][name]Mayuri[line]“I don’t think I heard anything...”[%p]
[137][name]Rintaro[line]“...Oh. Well, alright.”[%p]
[138][name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin’s a weirdo!”[%p]
[139][name]Mayuri[line]“Bye bye! Tutturu♪”[%p]
[140]Mayuri leaves, this time for good, though she pauses to wave at least a half-dozen times before disappearing beyond the archway.[%p]
[141][name]Luka[line]“Thanks for waiting, Okabe-san.”[%p]
[142]Lukako returns shortly after Mayuri leaves.[%p]
[143]In his hands is the white zigzaggy thing I asked for.[%p]
[144][name]Luka[line]“Dad let me borrow it. Thank goodness.”[%p]
[145][name]Luka[line]“Um, did Mayuri-chan leave?”[%p]
[146][name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t worry about Mayuri. Begin the exorcism at once, Lukako!”[%p]
[147][name]Luka[line]“Um, okay, but do you really want me to do it? What exactly am I exorcising, anyway?”[%p]
[148]Lukako is flustered.[%p]
[149]Is he really up to this? I’m beginning to doubt.[%p]
[150]I should have known better. The instant doubt touches my heart, a terrible chill shoots up my spine.[%p]
[151][name]Rintaro[line]“Guh! It’s the evil spirit... in my arm!”[%p]
[152]I grab my violently shaking wrist.[%p]
[153][name]Rintaro[line]“Be still, foul spirit! Guh... Hurry, Lukako! It’s trying to take over!”[%p]
[154][name]Luka[line]“N-no way! Please hang in there, Okabe-san!”[%p]
[155][name]Rintaro[line]“I’m not Okabe-san!”[%p]
[156][name]Luka[line]“I’m sorry, Kyouma-san! Ahh, but what should I...”[%p]
[157][name]Rintaro[line]“The exorcism... hurry! Just do it... like I taught you!”[%p]
[158][name]Luka[line]“O-okay!”[%p]
[159]With a serious look on his face, Lukako grasps the [color index="A0140000"]oonusa[color index="800000"] with both hands as if it were a sword.[%p]
[160]His stance is impressive. I’ve taught him well.[%p]
[161][name]Luka[line]“Ummm... ummm...”[%p]
[162]His face is red, and he can barely talk.[%p]
[163]It looks like he wants to say something, but is hesitating.[%p]
[164]Panicking because he feels awkward? Tch. Amateur![%p]
[165][name]Rintaro[line]“Please... Luka... expel... this spirit... from me...”[%p]
[166][name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t... want to... kill you!”[%p]
[167][name]Luka[line]“Uuh...”[%p]
[168]Lukako starts crying.[%p]
[169]Looks like he’s really worried.[%p]
[170]Reason tells me he’s a guy, but his lovely appearance makes me feel guilty. Like I made a frail girl cry.[%p]
[171]But despite the tears welling up in his eyes, it looks like Lukako’s managed to work up his resolve.[%p]
[172][name]Luka[line]“H-hear me, evil spirit!”[%p]
[173]He raises the [color index="A0140000"]oonusa[color index="800000"] up high, shaking it left and right.[%p]
[174][name]Luka[line]“Please leave from Okabe -- I mean Kyouma-san!”[%p]
[175][name]Rintaro[line]“That’s great! Now strike my arm with those zigzags!”[%p]
[176][name]Luka[line]“Ei!!”[%p]
[177]The tip of the [color index="A0140000"]oonusa[color index="800000"] touches my upper arm.[%p]
[178]In an anime, this would be the cue for some dramatic shockwave to occur, but nothing like that happens.[%p]
[179]The only sound is the chirping of cicadas.[%p]
[180][name]Luka[line]“D-did it work?”[%p]
[181]I take a deep breath.[%p]
[182]The trembling in my arm has stopped.[%p]
[183][name]Rintaro[line]“...I’m okay. Looks like you drove away the evil spirit. Good job, Lukako.”[%p]
[184]Lukako sighs in relief and blushes.[%p]
[185][name]Luka[line]“I’m glad I was able to help.”[%p]
[186]His shy smile really does make him look like a girl.[%p]
