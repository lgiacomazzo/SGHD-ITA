[0]After I get back to the lab, I take the broken TV down to the Braun Tube Workshop for repairs.[%p]
[1]Daru and Mayuri have already gone home, so I have to carry the TV down the narrow staircase by myself. It’s brutal, back-breaking work, but I manage.[%p]
[2]I push the workshop door open with my hips and head inside.[%p]
[3]The room is dimly lit by the setting sun, but the gloom is offset by the glare from the gigantic CRT in the center of the room.[%p]
[4]A 42-inch CRT television.[%p]
[5]It doesn’t seem like something you could get in modern Japan.[%p]
[6]With LCD TVs becoming the new standard, I seriously doubt anyone would want a bulky, old CRT.[%p]
[7][name]???[line]“Yo! What’s up, Okabe?”[%p]
[8]Sitting in front of the huge CRT is an equally huge man reading a sports newspaper.[%p]
[9]He’s the workshop’s manager, actually the owner of this whole building, Tennouji Yuugo.[%p]
[10]I call him Mister Braun.[%p]
[11]It’s a fitting name for someone who loves Braun tubes.[%p]
[12][name]Rintaro[line]“What’s up? That TV you gave me broke, that’s what.”[%p]
[13][name]Tennouji[line]“I bet you were treating it rough, weren’t ya?”[%p]
[14]I barely manage to set the heavy TV on the counter.[%p]
[15][name]Tennouji[line]“Love. You gotta’ treat ’em with love!”[%p]
[16]A muscle-bound bald guy talking about love...[%p]
[17]It sends shivers down my spine.[%p]
[18][name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll need repairs post-haste.”[%p]
[19][name]Tennouji[line]“Man, why do you always talk like that?”[%p]
[20]Mister Braun begins investigating the cause of the problem. With nothing better to do, I look around the store.[%p]
[21]I don’t know if it’s just the dust hanging in the air, but something feels stagnant about this place.[%p]
[22]There are CRT screens everywhere.[%p]
[23]The haphazard layout makes them seem like junk, but they’re all functional, according to Mister Braun.[%p]
[24]He’s got a full range of both old and new. Some of them are probably older than me. There are even some flat screen and HD CRTs that came out just before LCDs took the market.[%p]
[25][name]Rintaro[line]“You’re open late today. Don’t you usually close around seven?”[%p]
[26]The crowds in Akiba thin quickly at night.[%p]
[27]All the major electronics stores close around eight or nine o’clock.[%p]
[28]And then, as if the liveliness of the day was simply a lie, the town goes silent.[%p]
[29][name]Tennouji[line]“I’m expecting someone.”[%p]
[30][name]Rintaro[line]“You mean that chipmunk of yours?”[%p]
[31][name]Tennouji[line]“Don’t be calling my little girl a chipmunk, you hear?”[%p]
[32]The manager glares at me and takes a photo from his wallet.[%p]
[33]It is a picture of a young girl, shyly making a peace sign at the camera.[%p]
[34]One might assume this muscle-bound man to be some kind of pervert, but the girl is actually his daughter. She’s about 12 years old now, I think.[%p]
[35]His love for her is second only to his love for CRTs. Or was it the other way around?[%p]
[36]I see her in the store every now and again. What was her name again?[%p]
[37][name]Tennouji[line]“If you touch Nae, you’re dead.”[%p]
[38]That’s it. Nae. A rare name that means “to braid.” [%p]
[39]She pops up at the store now and again, so we’ve interacted with her before.[%p]
[40]And by ’we’ I mean Mayuri, since she’s the only one Nae gets along with.[%p]
[41]Nae always hides when she sees me or Daru.[%p]
[42]I must admit, I’m impressed she can sense my aura of madness at such an early age. [%p]
[43]Mister Braun makes a grandiose kissing gesture at his daughter’s photo.[%p]
[44]Once again, shivers down my spine.[%p]
[45][name]Rintaro[line]“But seriously, besides your daughter, has this workshop ever had a customer?”[%p]
[46]I’ve been renting the second floor for about six months, but I don’t recall ever seeing a customer.[%p]
[47]I would be surprised if this place were actually making any money.[%p]
[48][name]Tennouji[line]“Ain’t a customer.”[%p]
[49]He puts away the photo and goes back to checking the TV, leaving me with that vague answer.[%p]
[50][name]Tennouji[line]“Hmm, there’s probably just a loose solder on the board. I can fix it.”[%p]
[51][name]Rintaro[line]“Really? Well, then by all means.”[%p]
[52][name]Tennouji[line]“Hold on. I’ll get you an estimate.”[%p]
[53][name]Rintaro[line]“What!? You’re charging me!?”[%p]
[54][name]Tennouji[line]“What’d you think? This ain’t some charity!”[%p]
[55][name]Rintaro[line]“You’re the one who gave us the TV!”[%p]
[56][name]Tennouji[line]“Yeah, so what? Never said I’d service it for free.”[%p]
[57][name]Rintaro[line]“Curse you... you have some gall to say that after foisting a half-broken piece of junk onto us!”[%p]
[58][name]Tennouji[line]“Oh, shut up. If you don’t want it, I can take it back. Though I’ll have to charge ya for its safe disposal.”[%p]
[59][name]Rintaro[line]“Extortion! You dare cheat the man who very well may change the future of mankind!?”[%p]
[60][name]Tennouji[line]“Hah? Who’s that, now?”[%p]
[61][name]Rintaro[line]“Me, of course. Who else?”[%p]
[62][name]Tennouji[line]“Brush your teeth and go to sleep, kid. You’ve got some nerve to be back-talking when I’m lettin’ you rent the second floor for next to nothing.”[%p]
[63][name]Rintaro[line]“Hmph. You shall have your money, Mister Braun.”[%p]
[64]In the end, I’m no match for him.[%p]
[65]Just then, I hear the door open.[%p]
[66]I look up to see that a girl has entered the store.[%p]
[67]She’s wearing a vintage jacket and tight shorts that highlight her long limbs and athletic figure. I find myself particularly impressed by her well-defined thighs.[%p]
[68][name]???[line]“Wazzaaap!”[%p]
[69][name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[70][name]Tennouji[line]“...”[%p]
[71]Suddenly, time stops.[%p]
[72]It feels like someone activated [color index="820000"]The World[color index="800000"].[%p]
[73][name]???[line]“Um...?”[%p]
[74]The girl is still standing there with her arm in the air. Her smile gradually fades into confusion.[%p]
[75]What kind of reaction was she hoping for? Seriously.[%p]
[76]Anyway, is she the person Mister Braun was expecting?[%p]
[77]Maybe she’s someone he knows personally.[%p]
[78]Another daughter?[%p]
[79]Or, dare I say, his girlfriend?[%p]
[80]She finally drops her pose and clears her throat.[%p]
[81][name]Amane[line]“Um, I called earlier. I’m Amane.”[%p]
[82]And just like that, time starts moving again.[%p]
[83][name]Tennouji[line]“Oh, so you’re the kid for the job interview. I’m Tennouji, the manager.”[%p]
[84][name]Rintaro[line]“A job interview!? This young woman!?”[%p]
[85][name]Rintaro[line]“You want to work at the dull, dirty, depressing, debt-ridden Braun Tube Workshop with this filthy old manager?”[%p]
[86][name]Tennouji[line]“You want an extra thousand yen added to your rent?”[%p]
[87][name]Rintaro[line]“...My words are but the truth. Though I suppose it’s not my place to get involved.”[%p]
[88][name]Rintaro[line]“Anyway, I had no idea the Braun Tube Workshop was hiring. You always look so... free. I didn’t know you needed the help.”[%p]
[89][name]Amane[line]“Actually, I’m the one who begged for the job.”[%p]
[90]The girl looks a little embarrassed.[%p]
[91][name]Amane[line]“The boss refused at first, but I wouldn’t take no for an answer.”[%p]
[92]That’s honestly surprising.[%p]
[93][name]Tennouji[line]“Kids with drive are rare these days. Take a seat right there, young lady.”[%p]
[94][name]Amane[line]“Oh, thank you.”[%p]
[95]Looks like they’re going to have a formal interview. I was going to leave, but since Mister Braun hasn’t kicked me out, I’ll stick around a bit longer.[%p]
[96]The girl’s expression is stiff.[%p]
[97]I guess she’s nervous.[%p]
[98]Just because of a part-time job interview?[%p]
[99]In contrast to how she said she “wouldn’t take no for an answer,” she doesn’t seem so enthusiastic.[%p]
[100][name]Tennouji[line]“Right. What was your name again?”[%p]
[101][name]Amane[line]“Amane Suzuha.”[%p]
[102][name]Tennouji[line]“Age?”[%p]
[103][name]Amane[line]“18.”[%p]
[104]Same as me.[%p]
[105][name]Tennouji[line]“Student?”[%p]
[106][name]Amane[line]“No.”[%p]
[107]She shakes her head.[%p]
[108][name]Tennouji[line]“Why do you want to work here?”[%p]
[109][name]Suzuha[line]“Because I love CRTs.”[%p]
[110][name]Tennouji[line]“Hired! You start tomorrow!”[%p]
[111][name]Rintaro[line]“Wait, what? Is this some sort of joke? Are we on camera!?”[%p]
[112][name]Suzuha[line]“Thanks, boss.”[%p]
[113]Finally, Amane Suzuha seems to relax.[%p]
[114]Then she looks at me.[%p]
[115][name]Suzuha[line]“Um, who are you?”[%p]
[116][name]Rintaro[line]“You... dare ask my name? Banish the thought from your head, girl. To learn it would place your life in jeopardy.”[%p]
[117][name]Rintaro[line]“Countless women have learned my name only to find themselves targets of the Organization. Sarah in America, Claudia in Italy, Simone in France... I won’t put anyone else in danger.”[%p]
[118][name]Tennouji[line]“Hey, stop pulling things outta yer ass.”[%p]
[119]He just doesn’t understand my pain.[%p]
[120][name]Tennouji[line]“This idiot rents the second floor. Name’s Okabe Rintaro.”[%p]
[121][name]Rintaro[line]“My name is not Okabe. It’s Hououin--”[%p]
[122][name]Tennouji[line]“Quit it, or I raise your rent.”[%p]
[123][name]Rintaro[line]“...I’m Okabe Rintaro.”[%p]
[124]The girl stands up, places her hand on my shoulder, and looks at me with a serious expression.[%p]
[125][name]Suzuha[line]“I don’t know anything about this Organization that’s after you.”[%p]
[126][name]Suzuha[line]“But if you’re ever in trouble, Okabe Rintaro, let me know. I can help with stuff like that.”[%p]
[127][name]Rintaro[line]“...Huh?”[%p]
[128][name]Tennouji[line]“...?”[%p]
[129]Stuff... like what?[%p]
[130][name]Suzuha[line]“If necessary, I can hurt them so bad they’ll never bother you again.”[%p]
[131][name]Rintaro[line]“Mister Braun, I don’t think you should hire her.”[%p]
[132][name]Tennouji[line]“Yeah. She might be a wild one. I’ll fire her if she causes any trouble. Anyway, ignore that Organization nonsense. It’s all in Okabe’s head.”[%p]
[133][name]Suzuha[line]“It is?”[%p]
[134][name]Rintaro[line]“You just keep thinking that.”[%p]
[135]But some day, the world will kneel before me. Muhahaha![%p]
[136]And then, Amane Suzuha stares straight at me again.[%p]
[137]Maybe she has a habit of looking people in the eye.[%p]
[138][name]Suzuha[line]“So that’s the current trend. Thanks for the tip!”[%p]
[139]Trend? I don’t think so.[%p]
