[0][name]???[line]“Hey, what are you mumbling about?”[%p]
[1]There’s no sound from the phone against my right ear. Only silence.[%p]
[2]I am baking in the summer sun.[%p]
[3]Sweat slowly slides down my chin and drips onto the asphalt.[%p]
[4][name]???[line]“Okarin? Earth to Okarin!”[%p]
[5]A girl is standing in front of me.[%p]
[6]She calls my name with an inquisitive tilt of her head.[%p]
[7]We are about to infiltrate deep into enemy territory. Yet despite the imminent risk of death, there is no hint of tension on her innocent, childlike features.[%p]
[8]I cover my phone’s mouthpiece and turn to the girl with an index finger to my lips.[%p]
[9][name]???[line]“You talking to someone?”[%p]
[10]I nod and put my phone back to my ear.[%p]
[11]Still no sound from the other side.[%p]
[12]My contact is wise to maintain silence. The whole area could be bugged.[%p]
[13][name]Rintaro[line]“...No, I was just talking to someone. Everything’s fine. I’m about to infiltrate the assembly hall.”[%p]
[14]Still no reply.[%p]
[15]Looks like they just want my report.[%p]
[16]It’s too dangerous to waste time talking here anyway.[%p]
[17][name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah, Doctor Nakabachi got the jump on us, but I’ll make sure he tells us everything.”[%p]
[18][name]Rintaro[line]“What!? [color index="820000"]The Organization[color index="800000"] is already on the move!?”[%p]
[19]I open my eyes wide to match my shocked tone.[%p]
[20]The girl turns towards me in surprise.[%p]
[21]I sigh, shaking my head as I rub my temples.[%p]
[22][name]Rintaro[line]“I see... so that’s the choice of Steins Gate. El Psy Kongroo.”[%p]
[23]I speak the parting words, then pocket my cellphone.[%p]
[24]Steins Gate. Some know it as Fate; to others, it is the Will of God.[%p]
[25]You could count on one hand the people in this world aware of its true nature.[%p]
[26]In any case, we should begin the infiltration.[%p]
[27]I advance towards Radi-Kan, which is just across the street from the train station.[%p]
[28]Of course, this is enemy territory. I can’t just stride through the front door like an average person.[%p]
[29]I bypass the elevators and escalators and head to the 8th floor by the stairwell.[%p]
[30]But I only make it to the 7th floor before I have to stop and rest.[%p]
[31][name]Mayuri[line]“Who was that on the phone?”[%p]
[32]The girl -- Shiina Mayuri -- immediately resumes our conversation. She followed me all the way here, and she isn’t even short of breath.[%p]
[33]I, on the other hand, am gasping for air with my hands on my knees.[%p]
[34]Who would have thought an 8-story building would be so tall?[%p]
[35]I turn to Mayuri while wiping the sweat off my brow.[%p]
[36][name]Rintaro[line]“If I told you, I’d have to kill you.”[%p]
[37][name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, wow. Thanks, Okarin!”[%p]
[38]Mayuri smiles happily and doesn’t pry any further.[%p]
[39]As always, she is quick to understand my position.[%p]
[40]We’ve known each other since we were both little.[%p]
[41]Mayuri is 17 -- two years younger than me -- so she’s more like a little sister than a typical childhood friend.[%p]
[42]I’ve been looking out for her as long as I can remember.[%p]
[43]I used to hope that Mayuri might become the key to Steins Gate, but now I’ve reconsidered.[%p]
[44]I don’t want that terrible fate for her. She should live a normal life.[%p]
[45]That is my present wish.[%p]
[46]We continue to the 8th floor and enter the assembly hall. In front of us stands a cheap looking stage with a podium and a sign reading “Doctor Nakabachi’s Time Machine Press Conference”.[%p]
[47][name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin! Okarin!”[%p]
[48]Mayuri insists on calling me Okarin, but it’s neither my real name nor my codename. It’s just one of those annoying nicknames people use.[%p]
[49][name]Rintaro[line]“How many times do I have to tell you? Don’t call me Okarin.”[%p]
[50][name]Mayuri[line]“Huh? But I’ve always called you that.”[%p]
[51][name]Rintaro[line]“That was then! I have since become Hououin Kyouma, the insane mad scientist hunted by secret organizations the world over. Muhahaha!”[%p]
[52][name]Mayuri[line]“But that’s too hard to remember.”[%p]
[53]In any case, Hououin Kyouma is my [color index="820000"]true name[color index="800000"].[%p]
[54][name]Mayuri[line]“And besides, it doesn’t even sound like Okabe Rintaro. You’re weird, ehehe!”[%p]
[55]Cease your foolish laughter![%p]
[56]Okabe Rintaro may be my real name, but I have rejected it, for it is stupid.[%p]
[57]And so I also hate the derivative “Okarin.”[%p]
[58]Come on, it sounds like that elf boy’s blue pipe thing.[%p]
[59][name]Mayuri[line]“So, Okarin, can I ask you something?”[%p]
[60]In one ear and out the other.[%p]
[61]She’s been calling me that for five years now, so maybe it’s time to give up.[%p]
[62][name]Mayuri[line]“What are we doing here?”[%p]
[63][name]Rintaro[line]“Wait. You followed me here without knowing why?”[%p]
[64][name]Mayuri[line]“Yup.”[%p]
[65]She nods without dropping her smile.[%p]
[66][name]Rintaro[line]“We’re here for Doctor Nakabachi’s press conference.”[%p]
[67]We’re standing in the assembly hall on the 8th floor of Radi-Kan. It is here that the conference will be held.[%p]
[68]Doctor Nakabachi is an inventor. He appears on TV from time to time and has a few patents under his belt, but mostly he is treated as a curiosity.[%p]
[69][name]Mayuri[line]“Press conference? But where are the reporters?”[%p]
[70]Mayuri’s right.[%p]
[71]I’ve scanned the entire hall, but there’s no one who looks like a reputable reporter or cameraman.[%p]
[72]There are only about ten of us standing in the hall, including me.[%p]
[73]Considering Nakabachi’s moderate media presence and the fact that he claims to have invented a time machine, I would have expected more.[%p]
[74][name]Rintaro[line]“Could this be the Organization working its twisted influence?”[%p]
[75]I twist my lips into a sneer.[%p]
[76]I thought that Nakabachi was like me, a scientist fighting to overthrow the Organization.[%p]
[77]But this press conference suggests other motives at work. Our enemies won’t miss this chance.[%p]
[78][name]Rintaro[line]“I’d prefer not to get wrapped up in his mess.”[%p]
[79]Nevertheless, I’m interested in what he has to say.[%p]
[80]That’s why I’m here, blowing an afternoon of my precious summer holiday.[%p]
[81]Mayuri ponders my utterance for a while before finally turning her head.[%p]
[82][name]Mayuri[line]“You wrapped something? Is it his birthday too? Ehehe!”[%p]
[83]I let out a sigh.[%p]
[84]Mayuri is known to not only make bad jokes, but to laugh at them too.[%p]
[85]She’s always been... special.[%p]
[86][name]Rintaro[line]“Keep your guard up, Mayuri. I suspect this won’t be a normal confer--”[%p]
[87]I didn’t even finish my sentence![%p]
[88]Are we under attack!? Are they trying to fry our brains with [color index="820000"]electromagnetic waves[color index="800000"]!?[%p]
[89]Dust falls from the ceiling as the floor shakes.[%p]
[90]We’re definitely under attack.[%p]
[91]It’s coming from above, but we’re on the top floor.[%p]
[92]All that’s above is the roof.[%p]
[93][name]Mayuri[line]“An earthquake? Is it magnitude 2? What does magnitude mean again?”[%p]
[94]No time to deal with Mayuri’s confusion. Something’s not right about this.[%p]
[95]I bolt out of the conference hall and run up the stairs to the roof, ignoring the “no trespassing” signs in my way.[%p]
[96]The door is open. Upon closer inspection, I realize that the lock has been broken.[%p]
[97]I open the door and see a billowing cloud of black smoke.[%p]
[98]There’s some kind of phosphorescent dust sparkling in the air.[%p]
[99][name]Rintaro[line]“An explosion!?”[%p]
[100]I can’t believe it. Was there really an explosion?[%p]
[101]My heart is racing.[%p]
[102]Damn, I don’t know what to do.[%p]
[103]Should I run away?[%p]
[104]But why an explosion? Terrorists?[%p]
[105]No, that doesn’t fit.[%p]
[106]I mean, how do you explain [color index="A0140000"]that[color index="800000"]!?[%p]
[107][name]Rintaro[line]“What the...”[%p]
[108]A strange machine is sitting in the middle of the roof.[%p]
[109]It’s huge, maybe three meters tall, and looks kind of like a satellite.[%p]
[110]Did that thing cause the shaking just now?[%p]
[111]Who put it here?[%p]
[112]Was it Doctor Nakabachi? Is this part of his presentation?[%p]
[113]Impossible. Even if that were the case, how the hell would he get it up here?[%p]
[114]My head is bursting with questions.[%p]
[115]As I search for the courage to approach the machine, a throng of reporters and building staff bursts onto the rooftop.[%p]
[116]They look just as confused as I am.[%p]
[117][name]Woman[line]“Please stay back, everybody!”[%p]
[118]And then a woman, who I assume is a staff member, appears to wave us back.[%p]
[119][name]Woman[line]“The press conference will proceed as scheduled!”[%p]
[120]Is she trying to hide something?[%p]
[121]Her response was unusually quick, almost like she’s trying to keep me away from that device.[%p]
[122][name]Rintaro[line]“I’ve got a nose for conspiracies, and this stinks of a coverup. What are they hiding? What was that explosion?”[%p]
[123]I want to know... but I shouldn’t risk getting any closer.[%p]
[124]I turn and leave...[%p]
[125]...but not because I’m scared or anything like that.[%p]
[126]Staff members lead all of us back to the 8th floor.[%p]
[127]Mayuri is nowhere to be seen. She’s not in the event hall either.[%p]
[128]I find her on the 7th floor.[%p]
[129]Several [color index="820000"]capsule toy[color index="800000"] machines are lined up next to a plate reading “Birthplace of the Japanese PC”.[%p]
[130]She’s gazing upon them with a wistful look.[%p]
[131]I breathe a sigh of relief, then take out my phone.[%p]
[132][name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me. I’ve got a bad feeling about this. Something’s happening, and I have no idea what it is.”[%p]
[133][name]Rintaro[line]“...Yeah, I know. Don’t worry. I won’t do anything to jeopardize the mission. El Psy Kongroo.”[%p]
[134]After I speak the words and hang up, I am able to wipe the sweat from my forehead.[%p]
[135]My sweat is cold.[%p]
[136]Half of me hopes something will happen. The other half fears the same thing.[%p]
[137]I put away my phone and look back at Mayuri.[%p]
[138]She’s still staring at those capsule toys.[%p]
[139]She doesn’t seem to be worried about the explosion at all.[%p]
[140]I can’t decide if she’s level-headed or just air-headed.[%p]
[141][name]Rintaro[line]“What are you doing?”[%p]
[142][name]Mayuri[line]“Hmm?”[%p]
[143][name]Mayuri[line]“Well... I really want an Upa.”[%p]
[144]Just as I thought.[%p]
[145]Mayuri points to a capsule machine. The sign on the front says ’[color index="820000"]RaiNet Kakeru[color index="800000"] 3D Character Doll Series’.[%p]
[146]RaiNet Kakeru is a popular anime series with its own card game spinoff, RaiNet AccessBattlers. They even hold international tournaments.[%p]
[147]“Upa” is the series’s mascot character. It resembles an elliptical egg with limbs sticking out, like some kind of deformed dog.[%p]
[148]It’s what they call an “uglycute” character.[%p]
[149]High school girls find these creatures adorable for some reason. Last year, an ugly frog character was the rage. Its name escapes me, though.[%p]
[150][name]Rintaro[line]“Then go for it. I can’t guarantee you’ll get an Upa, though.”[%p]
[151]Mayuri gives me a troubled smile.[%p]
[152][name]Mayuri[line]“But Mayushii’s all out of 100-yen coins.”[%p]
[153]“Mayushii” is what Mayuri calls herself sometimes.[%p]
[154]According to her, it’s supposed to have an ☆ at the end -- Mayushii☆.[%p]
[155]But who really cares?[%p]
[156][name]Mayuri[line]“So, can I borrow 100 yen? Please?”[%p]
[157]She holds her hands out with a look like a begging puppy.[%p]
[158]Looks like she was planning this from the very beginning.[%p]
[159]Well, at least she didn’t say ’gimme’.[%p]
[160][name]Rintaro[line]“Do you think it’s that easy, Mayuri? You’ll get no money from me. Instead, I’ll show you just how harsh life really is.”[%p]
[161]I pull out a 100-yen coin, set it into the machine’s slot, and spin the lever.[%p]
[162][name]Mayuri[line]“Ah, ahh...”[%p]
[163]I open the capsule and take out the contents.[%p]
[164]Mayuri leans forward eagerly to see what I got.[%p]
[165][name]Mayuri[line]“It’s an Upa! And it’s metal! A Metal Upa!”[%p]
[166][name]Rintaro[line]“Is it rare?”[%p]
[167][name]Mayuri[line]“Super rare!”[%p]
[168]While I examine the Metal Upa, a boy who was watching us tries his luck on the same RaiNet machine.[%p]
[169][name]Boy[line]“Aw, a normal Upa...”[%p]
[170]He looks at my Metal Upa in resentment.[%p]
[171]I turn to see Mayuri’s sparkling eyes also fixed on the Upa.[%p]
[172]Hey, high school girl. You’re acting like a little kid.[%p]
[173][name]Rintaro[line]“Hmph. I give this creature of metal to you, Mayuri.”[%p]
[174]Honestly, I don’t want it.[%p]
[175][name]Mayuri[line]“Really!? Are you sure, Okarin?”[%p]
[176][name]Rintaro[line]“The name’s Hououin Kyouma!”[%p]
[177][name]Mayuri[line]“Ehehe! Thank you, Okarin.”[%p]
[178][name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[179]Is she doing it on purpose?[%p]
[180][name]Presenter[line]“Thank you all for coming to Doctor Nakabachi’s Time Machine Press Conference.”[%p]
[181]I hear the announcement from the floor above.[%p]
[182][name]Rintaro[line]“Sounds like they’re starting.”[%p]
[183]I head to the stairs.[%p]
[184]But Mayuri doesn’t follow.[%p]
[185][name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s go, Mayuri.”[%p]
[186][name]Mayuri[line]“Mm... just a sec. I gotta write my name.”[%p]
[187]She’s preoccupied with the Metal Upa. I go on ahead.[%p]
[188][name]Presenter[line]“Without further ado, I am pleased to introduce the inventor, Doctor Nakabachi! Please welcome him with a big round of applause!”[%p]
[189]Doctor Nakabachi enters to sparse applause.[%p]
[190]He walks up to the podium.[%p]
[191]He’s already wearing a frown, for some reason. I can feel his irritation from here.[%p]
[192][name]Nakabachi[line]“I am Doctor Nakabachi. Thank you all for coming.”[%p]
[193]Nakabachi takes the microphone and begins to speak, his voice brimming with confidence.[%p]
[194][name]Nakabachi[line]“Now then, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to begin with my theory of time travel, the greatest scientific breakthrough of the century.”[%p]
[195][name]Mayuri[line]“Did he really build a time machine?”[%p]
[196]Mayuri appears after writing her name on the Metal Upa. She’s a bit late, in more ways than one. What did she think a time machine presentation would be about?[%p]
[197]I take another look around the room.[%p]
[198]There are about 20 people now, including us, but still no media presence to speak of.[%p]
[199]So this is the extent of Doctor Nakabachi’s fame. No one believes that he invented a time machine.[%p]
[200]I was interested in what he had to say, true, but my expectations were no higher than the rest of the onlookers.[%p]
[201]And a good thing they weren’t. As he proceeds to explain his time machine design, my curiosity quickly turns to disappointment, then anger.[%p]
[202][name]Rintaro[line]“DOOOOOCTOOOOOOOORRR!!”[%p]
[203]My roar silences Nakabachi and draws the eye of every person in the room.[%p]
[204][name]Rintaro[line]“Do you take us for fools!?”[%p]
[205][name]Nakabachi[line]“Who the hell are you?”[%p]
[206][name]Rintaro[line]“Who the hell am I!? Someone who knows you for a fraud, that’s who!”[%p]
[207][name]Rintaro[line]“You stole your theory from [color index="820000"]John Titor[color index="800000"]! And you call yourself an inventor!?”[%p]
[208][name]Nakabachi[line]“S-someone throw this man out!”[%p]
[209][name]Rintaro[line]“You’re the one we should throw out, Doctor! Have you no shame!? You have no right to call yourself an inventor!”[%p]
[210][name]Nakabachi[line]“Shut your mouth, you little pest!”[%p]
[211]Just then, someone grabs my arm from behind.[%p]
[212]Quite convinced it’s an official here to throw me out, I turn around to glare him down.[%p]
[213][name]Rintaro[line]“Unhand me, you... huh?”[%p]
[214][name]???[line]“...”[%p]
[215]It’s a girl about my age.[%p]
[216]Her intense stare seems to challenge me. I take a step back.[%p]
[217]Her face looks somehow familiar. Where have I seen her before?[%p]
[218][name]Rintaro[line]“Ah...”[%p]
[219]We haven’t met, but I know her face.[%p]
[220]It’s Makise Kurisu.[%p]
[221]A few days ago, my friend Daru showed me a magazine article titled “Girl Genius Gives Lecture in Akihabara”.[%p]
[222]The article was about a 17-year-old girl who had just graduated from an American university. Her thesis was even published in a major scientific journal.[%p]
[223]Girl Genius, Makise Kurisu. I recognize the stubborn-looking girl from her photograph.[%p]
[224]She’s even wearing the exact same scowl.[%p]
[225]What business could such a genius have with me?[%p]
[226]She takes a quick look around the room, then turns back to me with a stern expression.[%p]
[227][name]Kurisu[line]“Could you come with me for a moment?”[%p]
[228]What’s with the attitude? She’s obviously not staff, and there’s no way that [color index="A0140000"]the[color index="800000"] Makise Kurisu would be working with someone like Doctor Nakabachi.[%p]
[229]Which means... no![%p]
[230][name]Rintaro[line]“Y-you’re with the Organization!?”[%p]
[231][name]Kurisu[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[232][name]Rintaro[line]“If their tendrils have gotten this far, then I’ve made a grave mistake.”[%p]
[233][name]Kurisu[line]“Stop fooling around and come with me.”[%p]
[234][name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[235]My outburst has already attracted too much attention.[%p]
[236]Nakabachi, in particular, looks like he wants to rip my head off. It must be mortifying to be exposed as a fraud by a bright young man like myself.[%p]
[237]Anyway, I mustn’t draw any more attention to myself. If the Organization gets wind of my presence here, it could endanger Mayuri -- to say nothing of these ignorant civilians.[%p]
[238]I let Makise Kurisu lead me out of the assembly hall.[%p]
[239][name]Rintaro[line]“Try anything and people are sure to notice. What will your superiors say then?”[%p]
[240][name]Kurisu[line]“What are you talking about?”[%p]
[241]She glares at me. Quite fiercely at that.[%p]
[242]Attractive though she may be, there is no innocence in her eyes.[%p]
[243]A beautiful agent, unmatched in cruelty.[%p]
[244]My heart beats in exhilaration from the danger.[%p]
[245]Looks like chaos really does get my blood pumping. Heh heh heh.[%p]
[246][name]Kurisu[line]“I just need to ask you something.”[%p]
[247][name]Rintaro[line]“What makes you think I’ll answer? I know how the Organization operates.”[%p]
[248][name]Kurisu[line]“What’s with this ’Organization’ stuff?”[%p]
[249]Instead of answering, I take out my phone and put it to my ear.[%p]
[250][name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me. I’ve been caught by an Organization agent. ...Yes, it’s Makise Kurisu. She’s a dangerous one. ...No, it’s fine. I’ll find a way to--”[%p]
[251][name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[252]Kurisu suddenly snatches the phone from my hand.[%p]
[253]What skill! I didn’t have time to react.[%p]
[254][name]Rintaro[line]“What are you doing!?”[%p]
[255][name]Kurisu[line]“Huh? Your phone’s off.”[%p]
[256][name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[257][name]Kurisu[line]“...Who were you talking to?”[%p]
[258]Her eyes pierce deep into my soul. I quickly look away.[%p]
[259]She’s good. Is she trying to attack my sense of identity in order to cause a mental break?[%p]
[260]Recover. This isn’t enough to sway me![%p]
[261][name]Rintaro[line]“Y-your techniques don’t work on me, but I’ll tell you anyway. That’s no ordinary phone. It’s designed to deactivate the moment it leaves my hand. Muhahaha!”[%p]
[262]Such measures are necessary to maintain secrecy. I know things that could get me killed.[%p]
[263]I quickly retrieve my phone and wipe the cold sweat off my forehead.[%p]
[264]Whew, that was close.[%p]
[265][name]Kurisu[line]“...So you talk to yourself.”[%p]
[266][name]Rintaro[line]“Guh!”[%p]
[267]This is bad. Ordinary methods don’t work on Makise Kurisu, the genius girl.[%p]
[268]On the contrary, she’s the one psyching me out![%p]
[269]Damn. Looks like I’ll have to make a tactical retreat.[%p]
[270]If I can just find an opening![%p]
[271]Suddenly, Kurisu steps up to me with a serious expression.[%p]
[272]She stares right at me, her huge eyes blazing with strength of will.[%p]
[273]Such fire. I can’t look away.[%p]
[274]Could someone with such pure eyes really be an Organization agent?[%p]
[275][name]Kurisu[line]“What were you trying to tell me earlier?”[%p]
[276]Earlier?[%p]
[277][name]Rintaro[line]“What are you talking about?”[%p]
[278][name]Kurisu[line]“About fifteen minutes ago. Before the conference started.”[%p]
[279]Nonsense. This is the first time we’ve met.[%p]
[280]I was with Mayuri and that Upa toy fifteen minutes ago.[%p]
[281][name]Kurisu[line]“You were trying to tell me something, right? You looked really upset.”[%p]
[282]Is this a trap? It does seem like one of the Organization’s dirty tricks.[%p]
[283]But would this girl do something that underhanded?[%p]
[284][name]Kurisu[line]“You looked like you were going to start crying any second.”[%p]
[285][name]Kurisu[line]“Why? Have we met before?”[%p]
[286]She seems sincere.[%p]
[287]That makes her even more suspicious.[%p]
[288]That’s right, don’t let her beauty fool you![%p]
[289]She’s a cold, calculating secret agent.[%p]
[290]If I show the slightest vulnerability, I’m done for![%p]
[291][name]Kurisu[line]“And how do you know my name?”[%p]
[292][name]Rintaro[line]“My knowledge has no limits.”[%p]
[293]I am a mad scientist, after all.[%p]
[294][name]Rintaro[line]“Genius girl, our next meeting shall be as enemies!”[%p]
[295][name]Kurisu[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[296][name]Rintaro[line]“Farewell! Muhahaha!”[%p]
[297]I spin around and take off down the stairs, ignoring her call to stop. Like I’d listen to the enemy.[%p]
[298][name]Rintaro[line]“Damn the Organization! They must be serious if they’re sending in agents like her!”[%p]
[299]I run all the way down to the 4th floor and check behind me. Once I’m convinced Makise Kurisu’s not tailing me, I sigh while rubbing my temples.[%p]
[300][name]Rintaro[line]“But I can’t let them capture me yet.”[%p]
[301]Well then, what do I do now?[%p]
[302]My mission was to attend the conference and evaluate Doctor Nakabachi’s research. Now that I know he’s a fraud, there’s no real point in going back.[%p]
[303]I guess I’ll just go home.[%p]
[304]But wait. Aren’t I forgetting something important?[%p]
[305]Let’s see now... what is it?[%p]
[306][name]Rintaro[line]“...Damn. I left Mayuri behind.”[%p]
[307]I knew she’d be a liability.[%p]
[308]I shouldn’t have brought her along. I was trying to prioritize her safety, but got careless.[%p]
[309]I’ll try calling her first. If she’s alright, then I can just have her meet me here.[%p]
[310]With that thought in mind, I take out my phone. I turn it on.[%p]
[311]And it rings just as I do.[%p]
[312][name]Rintaro[line]“Hm? An email?”[%p]
[313]It’s not just a regular email. There’s a video attached.[%p]
[314]And it’s from an unknown address.[%p]
[315]I open the video file with some trepidation.[%p]
[316][name]Rintaro[line]“...Hm?”[%p]
[317]There’s nothing but noise.[%p]
[318]Is this a prank? Or some sort of Makise Kurisu-style attack? Maybe the noise is some sort of make-people-go-crazy frequency.[%p]
[319]...No, wait, I don’t remember giving her my mail address, so I’m probably just thinking too hard.[%p]
[320]I curse myself for being gullible enough to play the video.[%p]
[321]I have more pressing matters to deal with anyway.[%p]
[322]I stop the video and call Mayuri’s phone from my address book.[%p]
[323][name]Rintaro[line]“Dammit, Mayuri. Why won’t you pick up?”[%p]
[324]Looks like I’ll have to go back to the assembly hall.[%p]
[325]But things will get messy if I bump heads with Makise Kurisu again.[%p]
[326][name]Rintaro[line]“Wait, don’t tell me! Did that femme fatale kidnap Mayuri!?”[%p]
[327][name]Rintaro[line]“Damn you! Is that how the Organization operates!?”[%p]
[328]Leaving without Mayuri isn’t an option.[%p]
[329]Call me overprotective, but she’s like a little sister to me, and there’s a very real danger that she might wander off somewhere the moment I let her out of my sight.[%p]
[330]Mayuri has always been like that. I never know if she’ll be there when I turn to look.[%p]
[331]...In a sense, that’s why I became Hououin Kyouma.[%p]
[332][name]Rintaro[line]“I have to go back for her.”[%p]
[333]The thought of climbing back up to the 8th floor is depressing, but I have no choice.[%p]
[334]When I get back to the assembly hall, Doctor Nakabachi’s conference has just finished.[%p]
[335]Nobody is on stage, and the phony inventor has already left.[%p]
[336]The 20 or so members of the audience are starting to pack up.[%p]
[337]I soon find Mayuri.[%p]
[338]She’s in the corner, looking lost.[%p]
[339]Well, at least she wasn’t kidnapped.[%p]
[340]Even better, I don’t see Makise Kurisu anywhere.[%p]
[341][name]Rintaro[line]“Heh, looks like I scared her off.”[%p]
[342][name]Rintaro[line]“So be it. I’ll let her go this time.”[%p]
[343]Still, I keep my eyes peeled as I run up to Mayuri.[%p]
[344][name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri! Why didn’t you pick up? We’re leaving.”[%p]
[345][name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin! My Metal Upa ran away.”[%p]
[346]She turns to me with a forlorn expression.[%p]
[347][name]Rintaro[line]“Ran away? What, it’s alive? That’s a little hard to believe.”[%p]
[348][name]Mayuri[line]“I think I dropped it...”[%p]
[349]I see, so she was looking for it.[%p]
[350]Not like it really matters.[%p]
[351][name]Rintaro[line]“Forget about it. You can always get another one.”[%p]
[352][name]Mayuri[line]“No way. Metal Upas sell upwards of 10,000 yen online, you know?”[%p]
[353][name]Rintaro[line]“Wait... what?”[%p]
[354]That toy was worth that much!?[%p]
[355][name]Rintaro[line]“Think, Mayuri! Where did you drop it!?”[%p]
[356][name]Mayuri[line]“I don’t know! That’s why I’m looking. And even if we find it, you can’t sell it, okay?”[%p]
[357][name]Rintaro[line]“Muhahaha! That 10,000 yen will fund my research!”[%p]
[358][name]Mayuri[line]“I said you can’t sell it! It even has Mayushii’s name on it.”[%p]
[359]Thus begins our search for the Metal Upa.[%p]
[360][name]Mayuri[line]“Tutturu♪ Upa, Upa, come out, come out, wherever you are!”[%p]
[361]Mayuri tries calling its name. I don’t know if she truly expects a response.[%p]
[362]By the way, “tutturu♪” is Mayuri’s catchphrase.[%p]
[363]It means... actually, I’ve never bothered to ask what it means.[%p]
[364]Anyway, the Metal Upa is nowhere to be found.[%p]
[365]Maybe she didn’t drop it in the assembly hall, but on the 7th floor landing near the capsule toy machines.[%p]
[366]Another possibility is that someone with an eye for rare items pilfered it.[%p]
[367]Just imagining the smug grin on that person’s face makes me writhe in envy.[%p]
[368][name]Rintaro[line]“What kind of man steals a helpless girl’s toy? Is there nothing in his heart but the lust for money!?”[%p]
[369][name]Mayuri[line]“Sounds like you, Okarin!”[%p]
[370]Woah, wasn’t expecting that from Mayuri.[%p]
[371][name]???[line]“AHHHHHHHHHHH!”[%p]
[372][name]Rintaro[line]“!?”[%p]
[373]Wh-what was that?[%p]
[374][name]Mayuri[line]“Was that a scream?”[%p]
[375]I think so...[%p]
[376]Only the presenter and a few other people are left in the assembly hall.[%p]
[377]Including Mayuri and me, less than half the audience remains.[%p]
[378]Everyone looks at each other anxiously, startled by the scream.[%p]
[379]Even I cannot suppress a shiver.[%p]
[380]First the explosion on the roof. Now this. What’s going on here?[%p]
[381]Mayuri squeezes my hand tight.[%p]
[382][name]Rintaro[line]“Stay here, Mayuri!”[%p]
[383]I take a deep breath, prepare myself, and head in the direction of the scream.[%p]
[384]The echoes lead me down a dark, empty hallway on the same floor.[%p]
[385]I’m pretty sure it came from around that corner.[%p]
[386]I crouch down and turn the corner slowly, keeping my eyes and ears peeled for any sign of danger.[%p]
[387]And there, at the end of the passage, I see it.[%p]
[388]There’s something on the ground.[%p]
[389]No... some[color index="A0140000"]one[color index="800000"].[%p]
[390]Motionless.[%p]
[391]Who is it?[%p]
[392]The clothes are familiar.[%p]
[393]...It can’t be.[%p]
[394][name]Rintaro[line]“Wha...”[%p]
[395]Makise Kurisu...[%p]
[396]Her face is turned away, but I know it’s her.[%p]
[397]The impertinent genius girl I just fought with ten minutes ago...[%p]
[398]...is now face down in a pool of bright red blood.[%p]
[399]She’s dead.[%p]
[400][name]Rintaro[line]“No... but... why?”[%p]
[401]Suddenly, I realize that I’m shaking.[%p]
[402]I want to run. Run away.[%p]
[403]I shouldn’t have come.[%p]
[404]This is wrong.[%p]
[405]Someone killed Makise Kurisu. There’s no other explanation.[%p]
[406]Who would do such a thing?[%p]
[407]There’s no one else here.[%p]
[408][name]Presenter[line]“Uwahhh!”[%p]
[409]I twist around in shock.[%p]
[410]Some other men have followed me.[%p]
[411]And every one of them is ghastly pale. They must have seen the body.[%p]
[412][name]Presenter[line]“Call the police!”[%p]
[413]A man cries out in panic. At this, everyone else starts screaming and running away.[%p]
[414]I follow them, of course. There’s absolutely no reason to stay here.[%p]
[415]Concern for Makise Kurisu is superseded by my instinctive urge to flee.[%p]
[416]When I get back to the assembly hall, Mayuri is waiting for me with tears in her eyes.[%p]
[417][name]Mayuri[line]“What happened, Okarin?”[%p]
[418][name]Rintaro[line]“W-we’re leaving!”[%p]
[419]I grab Mayuri’s hand and run.[%p]
[420]I race down the stairs, trying to drive the image of Kurisu’s dead body from my mind.[%p]
[421]But I can’t.[%p]
[422]The redness of her blood is burned into my mind, more than the sight of the body itself.[%p]
[423]That was my first time seeing a dead body.[%p]
[424]Is this what it’s like? When I realized that she was dead, I felt chilling terror and a surge of nausea. [%p]
[425]But that was all I felt. Fear and disgust.[%p]
[426]Shouldn’t there be something more?[%p]
[427]I guess I just didn’t know her that well.[%p]
[428][name]Rintaro[line]“Haah, haah...”[%p]
[429]I finally stop once we get out to the main street, Chuo-[color index="820000"]dori[color index="800000"].[%p]
[430]My chest pounds, my breathing labored from running down the stairs at full speed.[%p]
[431][name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, what happened? You look really pale...”[%p]
[432]Mayuri doesn’t seem to comprehend the situation.[%p]
[433]I guess it’s because she didn’t see the body.[%p]
[434]She’s not even breathing hard.[%p]
[435]She looks slow, but she’s actually pretty fast on her feet.[%p]
[436][name]Rintaro[line]“Someone... died.”[%p]
[437][name]Mayuri[line]“Eh...”[%p]
[438]I take several deep breaths.[%p]
[439]The color of that blood still stains my brain.[%p]
[440]But I’ve calmed down a bit.[%p]
[441]Makise Kurisu is dead.[%p]
[442]And I don’t know who the killer is.[%p]
[443]Sirens in the distance. I guess an ambulance will be here soon.[%p]
[444]Then the police will arrive, and this area will become a crime scene.[%p]
[445]But for now, the crowds milling through Akihabara have no idea what has happened.[%p]
[446]Everyone is going about their business as usual, the neverending search for electronics, [color index="820000"]moe[color index="800000"], and porn.[%p]
[447]Just another day in Akihabara.[%p]
[448]I take my phone out of my pocket, perhaps out of reflex.[%p]
[449]I’m not sure what I plan to do with it.[%p]
[450]Oh, I know. My friend Daru. I’ll tell him what happened just now, since he knows about Makise Kurisu.[%p]
[451]I suppose it might be disrespectful to the victim.[%p]
[452]But my adrenaline is pumping. I can’t make calm decisions after witnessing something like that firsthand.[%p]
[453]That’s how humans are, after all.[%p]
[454]We’re not as special as we like to believe.[%p]
[455]At the end of the day, we’re nothing but dirty, slime-like flesh.[%p]
[456]Our souls fester like semen left to rot in the womb.[%p]
[457]That’s how we humans are.[%p]
[458]While wallowing in a bit of angst, I begin to type on my phone.[%p]
[459]“Someone stabbed Makise Kurisu. Don’t know who. Looked bad. Hope she’s okay.”[%p]
[460]I don’t know if she was stabbed. That just seems like the most logical explanation, given the amount of blood and the absence of a gunshot.[%p]
[461]On the other hand, I didn’t write that she was dead, even though I’m pretty sure she was.[%p]
[462]I can’t exactly explain why I didn’t.[%p]
[463]If I had to say, I guess I felt like writing it down would set it in stone.[%p]
[464]It might make me feel guilty as well.[%p]
[465]The thought brings a smirk to my face. It’s not like I’m the one who killed her. Why should I feel guilty?[%p]
[466]I just saw someone’s death up close, and only a few minutes later, I’m smiling.[%p]
[467]Am I really that cruel and cold?[%p]
[468]Well, I am a fiendish mad scientist, so it suits me.[%p]
[469]I finish typing and place my thumb over the send button.[%p]
[470]And then...[%p]
[471]I press down.[%p]
[472]Sending...[%p]
[473][name]Rintaro[line]“Wha!?”[%p]
[474]What was that?[%p]
[475]Wait! Look around![%p]
[476][name]Rintaro[line]“They’re gone...”[%p]
[477]Summer break.[%p]
[478]Noon.[%p]
[479]The busiest street in town.[%p]
[480]Just now, thousands of pedestrians vanished into thin air.[%p]
[481]Is this a dream? Am I hallucinating?[%p]
[482]I don’t know.[%p]
[483]But they’re gone.[%p]
[484]I saw them vanish with my own two eyes.[%p]
[485]I stand petrified, speechless, and alone on the empty street.[%p]
[486]Desperate to find someone, anyone, I look up.[%p]
[487]And there, at the top of Radi-Kan...[%p]
[488]Sticking out from the 8th floor event hall where we just were...[%p]
[489]Is a crashed satellite.[%p]
