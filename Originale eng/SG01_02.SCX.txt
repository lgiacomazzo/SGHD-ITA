[0][name]Rintaro[line]“They’re gone...”[%p]
[1]As I left Radi-Kan, everyone vanished before my eyes. I can’t explain it.[%p]
[2]And it wasn’t just the people on the street.[%p]
[3]The people in the stores, gone. In the restaurants, gone. Even the cars vanished, drivers and all.[%p]
[4]And it all happened in the blink of an eye.[%p]
[5]Suddenly, an empty city spread before me.[%p]
[6]I could still hear the music from the stores, but those catchy melodies were the only sounds of life remaining.[%p]
[7]Heat was rising from the asphalt in waves, but I felt only a cold chill down my spine.[%p]
[8]I just stood there, breathless, until--[%p]
[9][name]Mayuri[line]“What’s wrong?”[%p]
[10]Mayuri’s voice brought me back to reality.[%p]
[11]Mayuri hadn’t disappeared.[%p]
[12]She was right there, looking at me with questioning eyes.[%p]
[13][name]Rintaro[line]“E-everyone disappeared just now, right!?”[%p]
[14][name]Mayuri[line]“Huh?”[%p]
[15][name]Rintaro[line]“You saw it too, right!? Just now, before our very eyes!”[%p]
[16]Panic took hold as the enormity of what had just happened struck me.[%p]
[17]Unable to control myself, I grabbed Mayuri by her slender shoulders and shook her.[%p]
[18][name]Rintaro[line]“Did you see it, Mayuri!? You saw it, right!?”[%p]
[19][name]Mayuri[line]“Hmmm? Huhhhhh?”[%p]
[20]Mayuri’s head flopped back and forth from my shaking.[%p]
[21][name]Mayuri[line]“IIIII diiiiidn’t seeeee anythiiiiing!”[%p]
[22][name]Rintaro[line]“You... didn’t?”[%p]
[23]I stopped shaking her and looked straight into her eyes.[%p]
[24]She returned my gaze with eyes clear as glass marbles.[%p]
[25][name]Rintaro[line]“You saw nothing? Nothing at all!? There were people here a second ago, weren’t there!?”[%p]
[26][name]Mayuri[line]“...There were?”[%p]
[27][name]Rintaro[line]“Even the store employees are gone! That’s impossible by any measure!”[%p]
[28][name]Mayuri[line]“Of course they are...”[%p]
[29]Her reply didn’t make any sense.[%p]
[30][name]Mayuri[line]“It was like this when we got here. Oh, I know! You’re seeing things, aren’t you?”[%p]
[31][name]Mayuri[line]“I’m sure it’s ’cause of the heat! Tutturu♪”[%p]
[32]How could she laugh at a time like this?[%p]
[33]I always thought she was a bit strange, but maybe her brain is actually broken.[%p]
[34]I realized that she couldn’t help me.[%p]
[35]With nowhere else to turn, I looked up at the bright blue sky.[%p]
[36]There wasn’t a cloud in sight. The scorching summer sun shone bright through the gaps between Akiba’s buildings.[%p]
[37]Naturally, my eyes drifted to the top floor of Radi-Kan, where I had been just a moment before.[%p]
[38]There it was. An enormous machine, like some kind of satellite, embedded in the roof of the building where, not five minutes before, I had found Makise Kurisu’s body in a pool of blood.[%p]
[39]What happened to her?[%p]
[40]Just before everyone disappeared, I could’ve sworn I heard an ambulance siren.[%p]
[41]Makise Kurisu might still be in that dark, narrow passageway -- cold, bloody, and alone.[%p]
[42]The thought disturbed me, but the question at the forefront of my mind was...[%p]
[43][name]Rintaro[line]“...What the hell is that satellite doing there?”[%p]
[44]Right before Doctor Nakabachi’s presentation, the building shook like a bomb had exploded. The roof door lock had been broken, and beyond it someone had placed a satellite-like machine, shrouded in smoke and glowing dust.[%p]
[45]When I first saw it, the satellite was “on” the rooftop.[%p]
[46]But that’s not what I was seeing now.[%p]
[47]This satellite had penetrated the top floor of the building, obliterating the room where Doctor Nakabachi’s press conference had been held.[%p]
[48]It must have fallen out of orbit without burning up in the atmosphere, somehow.[%p]
[49]I knew it was crazy, but what other explanation could there be?[%p]
[50]The real question was...[%p]
[51]When did that happen?[%p]
[52][name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri, about that satellite...”[%p]
[53][name]Mayuri[line]“Yup. What a surprise, huh?”[%p]
[54][name]Rintaro[line]“What do you mean? What was a surprise?”[%p]
[55][name]Mayuri[line]“It made a huge ’kaplow’ sound!”[%p]
[56]A huge ’kaplow’...[%p]
[57]It certainly did make a sound.[%p]
[58]But I don’t think it was “kaplow!”[%p]
[59]I’d say it was more like “Zzzzzznnnmmm.”[%p]
[60][name]Rintaro[line]“Did that satellite fall out of the sky?”[%p]
[61][name]Mayuri[line]“Did it? Do you think any aliens were on board?”[%p]
[62][name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[63]Had I lost my mind?[%p]
[64]What I had seen didn’t match at all with what Mayuri was saying.[%p]
[65]Suddenly, nothing seemed real. Had I dreamt it all?[%p]
[66][name]Policeman[line]“Hey! You two!”[%p]
[67]Just then, a uniformed policeman ran up to us, his expression stern.[%p]
[68][name]Policeman[line]“What do you think you’re doing here? This area is off-limits. You have to leave.”[%p]
[69][name]Mayuri[line]“We’re sorry!”[%p]
[70][name]Rintaro[line]“First, my good man -- let’s call you ’Officer A’ -- I have one question!”[%p]
[71][name]Officer A[line]“Officer A...?”[%p]
[72][name]Rintaro[line]“Thousands of people just vanished! You saw it too, didn’t you!?”[%p]
[73][name]Officer A[line]“What are you talking about? Get out of here!”[%p]
[74]I was quickly losing confidence in my own memories.[%p]
[75]I decided to tell him about Makise Kurisu and get him to call an ambulance, but before I could--[%p]
[76][name]Officer A[line]“Look, I don’t have time for your nonsense.”[%p]
[77]The policeman took me by the upper arm and said--[%p]
[78][margin top="-7168"][center]“No one got stabbed at Radi-Kan.”[%e]
[79]What? How could he say that with such certainty?[%p]
[80]While I was still trying to comprehend the situation, the policeman forcefully led us away.[%p]
[81]We were escorted up to [color index="820000"]UPX[color index="800000"] and released.[%p]
[82]There were people at UPX, like usual.[%p]
[83]Actually, there were far more people than usual. The place was packed.[%p]
[84]Just as Officer A had said, Chuo-dori had been blockaded by police, so nobody could enter.[%p]
[85]There was nothing we could do, so we headed back to the lab.[%p]
[86]And that brings us to the present.[%p]
[87]I’m baffled.[%p]
[88]Did the whole hour since the beginning of Nakabachi’s presentation really happen?[%p]
[89]I check online for any news.[%p]
[90]The net is buzzing about the mysterious machine that crashed into Radi-Kan.[%p]
[91]All of the major stations in Tokyo -- even [color index="820000"]ToTV[color index="800000"] -- are running special bulletins about it.[%p]
[92]Fortunately, it doesn’t look like anyone was hurt, but Chuo-dori is still closed off.[%p]
[93]Akihabara Station is jammed with reporters and curious onlookers.[%p]
[94]Nobody has mentioned anything about the disappearance of thousands of people from Akiba’s streets, nor about Makise Kurisu’s murder.[%p]
[95]It’s all a mystery.[%p]
[96]...A mystery?[%p]
[97][name]Rintaro[line]“I see... so that’s it!”[%p]
[98]From the sofa I spring to my feet, a wide grin on my face.[%p]
[99]Daru and Mayuri turn and stare.[%p]
[100][name]Rintaro[line]“This is all an elaborate coverup by the Organization! Their influence has corrupted local law enforcement, which means our entire government may already be under their control. My god!”[%p]
[101][name]Rintaro[line]“But they underestimated me, for I am not so easily played. One day, I will expose their deeds and put an end to their reign!”[%p]
[102]Having come to a satisfactory conclusion, I take a celebratory bottle of Dr P -- my favorite soda -- from the fridge.[%p]
[103]The lab has no air conditioning. Ice cold drinks are essential.[%p]
[104][name]Rintaro[line]“Ah, [color index="A0140000"]elixir intellectualis[color index="800000"], a drink fit for a genius!”[%p]
[105][name]Itaru[line]“Cola’s better.”[%p]
[106][name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin really loves his Dr P!”[%p]
[107][name]Rintaro[line]“I pity the man who knows not the greatness of this beverage! Muhahaha!”[%p]
