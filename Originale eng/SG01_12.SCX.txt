[0]Woah, I shouldn’t waste all day on @channel.[%p]
[1]We have more important things to deal with.[%p]
[2]Namely, the PhoneWave (name subject to change). We haven’t experimented with it since yesterday.[%p]
[3]It’s high time I figure out what’s going on with that thing.[%p]
[4]Earlier, I asked Daru to connect the PhoneWave (name subject to change) to the computer.[%p]
[5]He finished setting it up yesterday, and now he’s about to do the quick wire work in the development room.[%p]
[6][name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, Daru. What’s with the [color index="820000"]X68000[color index="800000"]?”[%p]
[7]I mean, it’s a 20-year-old machine with specs lower than my cellphone.[%p]
[8][name]Itaru[line]“It’s cool. Duh.”[%p]
[9][name]Rintaro[line]“So, it’s like the reason why some protagonists are [color index="820000"]odd-eyed[color index="800000"] even though they’re Japanese?”[%p]
[10][name]Itaru[line]“Not getting you, bro.”[%p]
[11][name]Rintaro[line]“It’s cool.”[%p]
[12][name]Itaru[line]“If it’s cool, then it’s cool.”[%p]
[13][name]Itaru[line]“Anyway, there wasn’t much of an option. This was the only PC we weren’t using.”[%p]
[14][name]Rintaro[line]“What about your new one?”[%p]
[15][name]Itaru[line]“No way. We don’t know what could happen when it’s connected to your crazy machine. It could kill the performance.”[%p]
[16]Selfish bastard.[%p]
[17]Besides, we made the PhoneWave (name subject to change) together. It’s “our” crazy machine.[%p]
[18][name]Itaru[line]“Anyway, did you do any research on the gelification?”[%p]
[19][name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah, at the university this morning.”[%p]
[20]Why would a banana gelify? What kind of science are we dealing with here?[%p]
[21][name]Rintaro[line]“I examined a sample under a microscope and found it was shredded at the molecular level.”[%p]
[22][name]Itaru[line]“Shredded?”[%p]
[23][name]Rintaro[line]“It’s not a mere [color index="820000"]phase transition[color index="800000"]. The banana became something entirely different.”[%p]
[24][name]Itaru[line]“Could it have rotted? ...Nah. There’s no way 2 minutes in the microwave could do that.”[%p]
[25][name]Rintaro[line]“Then I remembered about [color index="820000"]fractal structures[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[26][name]Itaru[line]“The [color index="820000"]Menger sponge[color index="800000"] thing?”[%p]
[27][name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah. It looked like something drilled holes into the banana. An infinite number of holes in a fractal pattern, right down to the nano level.”[%p]
[28][name]Itaru[line]“Whoa. What could do something like that?”[%p]
[29][name]Rintaro[line]“I have one hypothesis...”[%p]
[30]Adding a dramatic pause to build tension.[%p]
[31]Daru gulps, waiting for me to continue.[%p]
[32][name]Rintaro[line]“It’s the result of the microwave’s electromagnetic waves.”[%p]
[33][name]Itaru[line]“W-what does that mean?”[%p]
[34][name]Rintaro[line]“If my guess is correct, then our PhoneWave (name subject to change) has the potential to become a weapon of unprecedented destructive power, one that could change the face of war as we know it. Hehehe.”[%p]
[35]I twist my lips into a maniacal grin.[%p]
[36]Then I whip out my phone and put it to my ear.[%p]
[37][name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me. We’re proceeding to stage two of the plan. Soon they will learn... that Judgment Day is near.”[%p]
[38][name]Rintaro[line]“All shall be as Steins Gate wills. Resistance is futile. El Psy Kongroo.”[%p]
[39][name]Itaru[line]“Quit talking to your imaginary friend. I’m done with the wiring.”[%p]
[40]I want to explain that he’s not imaginary, but revealing the identity of my contact would be a betrayal.[%p]
[41]The last thing I need is another enemy, especially one whose power and cunning rivals that of the Organization.[%p]
[42]The PhoneWave (name subject to change) is now an indecipherable mess of wires.[%p]
[43]All we did was hook it up to a computer, yet it turned out like something [color index="820000"]MacDyver[color index="800000"] would put together.[%p]
[44]Now we can access the microwave’s [color index="820000"]terminal mode[color index="800000"] and see exactly what’s going on in its computer brain.[%p]
[45][name]Itaru[line]“Well? What’s next?”[%p]
[46][name]Rintaro[line]“We have bananas.”[%p]
[47]Just before I left MayQueen+Nyan², Mayuri asked me to buy some bananas.[%p]
[48]With her money.[%p]
[49]She’s too nice for her own good. Or maybe she didn’t even consider what would happen.[%p]
[50]By now, you’d think she’d know that if I buy bananas, I’m going to experiment on them.[%p]
[51]And so, I put the entire bunch of bananas into the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
[52][name]Itaru[line]“You know Mayu-shi’s gonna cry if you use them all, right? Wasn’t it her money?”[%p]
[53][name]Rintaro[line]“She donated that money to our research efforts.”[%p]
[54][name]Itaru[line]“You don’t have to use the whole thing. One is enough. One.”[%p]
[55]Daru retrieves the bananas, peels one from the bunch, and sticks it back inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
[56][name]Rintaro[line]“We’ll never reshape the fabric of society as long as money dictates the limits of our science.”[%p]
[57][name]Itaru[line]“You’re the only one who wants to reshape society, Okarin.”[%p]
[58]He lost all enthusiasm the second we got back to the lab.[%p]
[59]What a fickle man.[%p]
[60][name]Itaru[line]“C’mon, start the timer already.”[%p]
[61]Right. Now, where did I put my phone...[%p]
[62]Phone, phone...[%p]
[63]Call complete.[%p]
[64]Instant access.[%p]
[65][name]Guidance[line][color index="8A0000"]“Hello. This is the PhoneWave (name subject to change).”[%p]
[66]The Mayushii Guidance system.[%p]
[67][name]Guidance[line][color index="8A0000"]“You can operate the timer from this menu.”[%p]
[68][name]Guidance[line][color index="8A0000"]“After pushing the # button, please enter the heating time in seconds.”[%p]
[69][name]Rintaro[line]“In hindsight, we should’ve made the Mayushii Guidance skippable. Having to wait each time is quite annoying.”[%p]
[70][name]Guidance[line][color index="8A0000"]“For example, press ’#60’ for one minute.”[%p]
[71][name]Guidance[line][color index="8A0000"]“For two minutes, press ’#120’.”[%p]
[72]It’s finally over.[%p]
[73]Ok, entering “120#”...[%p]
[74]When I finish typing, the PhoneWave (name subject to change) starts up with a low hum.[%p]
[75][name]Itaru[line]“You messed up.”[%p]
[76]Crap, this is just normal heating.[%p]
[77]I manually set the timer back to 0 and start typing again.[%p]
[78]This time, we’re going to ignore the guidance and enter “120#”.[%p]
[79]Crap, I messed up.[%p]
[80]Let’s start over.[%p]
[81]Ignore the guidance and enter “120#”.[%p]
[82]Complete.[%p]
[83]The turntable inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change) begins to spin backwards.[%p]
[84][name]Rintaro[line]“Two minutes sure is long...”[%p]
[85]It doesn’t actually have to be two minutes. Mayuri had the timer set to two minutes when she first discovered the freezing function -- or whatever it is -- so we’re just reproducing that.[%p]
[86]Naturally, we have experimented with 60 seconds and 180 seconds too.[%p]
[87]If we set it shorter, the freezing only goes halfway, if at all. Conversely, setting it longer increases the effect.[%p]
[88][name]Itaru[line]“You know, if the microwave’s emissions are doing it, then shouldn’t our cells be getting gelified too?”[%p]
[89]While still looking bored, Daru finally gets into the discussion at hand.[%p]
[90][name]Rintaro[line]“Well, have you ever nuked yourself inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change)?”[%p]
[91][name]Itaru[line]“I can’t even fit in there.”[%p]
[92][name]Itaru[line]“Anyway, what’s your source on the electromagnetic waves?”[%p]
[93][name]Rintaro[line]“If you must know... it’s my mad scientist’s intuition.”[%p]
[94][name]Itaru[line]“Oh, so no facts.”[%p]
[95][name]Rintaro[line]“Edison once said, ’Without one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent of perspiration is wasted. So, inventors of the world... be inspired!’ End quote.”[%p]
[96][name]Itaru[line]“Wasn’t it ’Genius is one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent perspiration’?”[%p]
[97][name]Rintaro[line]“Sorry to disappoint, but in recent years it’s become common knowledge that [color index="A0140000"]that[color index="800000"] is a misquote. Muhahaha!”[%p]
[98][name]Itaru[line]“Edison said that? ’Be inspired!’...?”[%p]
[99][name]Rintaro[line]“Yes. ’Be inspired!’ he said.”[%p]
[100]I don’t know if that was exactly what he said, but I’m sure it was something along those lines.[%p]
[101]At least, that’s what the wiki said.[%p]
[102][name]Rintaro[line]“Therefore, as a genius mad scientist, I am always insp--”[%p]
[103]The PhoneWave (name subject to change) rings.[%p]
[104][name]Rintaro[line]“This is just going to gelify the banana like usual, isn’t it? We need a new experiment.”[%p]
[105]It feels like I wasted 120 seconds on nothing.[%p]
[106]Daru opens the PhoneWave (name subject to change)’s door and peeks inside.[%p]
[107][name]Itaru[line]“What? What!?”[%p]
[108]He rubs his eyes, blinks several times, then resumes staring into the microwave.[%p]
[109][name]Rintaro[line]“What are you doing?”[%p]
[110][name]Itaru[line]“Well... uh... it’s...”[%p]
[111][name]Itaru[line]“...gone.”[%p]
[112][name]Rintaro[line]“Gone? What’s gone?”[%p]
[113][name]Itaru[line]“The banana.”[%p]
[114]What is he talking about?[%p]
[115]I push Daru aside and look into the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
[116][name]Rintaro[line]“...It’s gone.”[%p]
[117]There’s nothing inside.[%p]
[118]The banana has vanished without a trace.[%p]
[119][name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[120]After a short pause to collect myself, I whip out my phone and speak into the silence.[%p]
[121][name]Rintaro[line]“It’s me. Slight problem. We may have awakened something... terrible.”[%p]
[122][name]Itaru[line]“Wh-what do you mean something terrible!?”[%p]
[123]I ignore Daru’s panicked cry.[%p]
[124]I’m surprised too. My heart’s pounding. But I try to appear calm.[%p]
[125][name]Rintaro[line]“I’m invoking Emergency Order 666. Activate the Coldheart Protocol!”[%p]
[126][name]Rintaro[line]“What!? What do you mean we need congressional approval!? There’s no time, you fool! Tokyo will be blasted to atoms!”[%p]
[127]I put my phone away after yelling.[%p]
[128][name]Itaru[line]“Y-you should be an actor.”[%p]
[129][name]Rintaro[line]“S-shut up, you Faris stalker! Where’d you hide the banana?”[%p]
[130][name]Itaru[line]“Who’s a stalker!?”[%p]
[131][name]Rintaro[line]“The banana. Where is it? Are you planning on become a street magician or something?”[%p]
[132][name]Itaru[line]“You’re the one who hid it, aren’t you?”[%p]
[133][name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[134][name]Itaru[line]“...”[%p]
[135]Uncomfortable silence.[%p]
[136]I realize my throat is dry.[%p]
[137][name]Rintaro[line]“Where the hell did it go!?”[%p]
[138][name]Itaru[line]“How should I know!?”[%p]
[139][name]Rintaro[line]“Where did you go? Banaana! BANAAANA!”[%p]
[140]I take the turntable out of the microwave, scour every nook and cranny, but find neither peel nor stem of the banana.[%p]
[141][name]Rintaro[line]“W-wait... I think I get it now! It’s not an electromagnetic weapon, it’s a teleportation device!”[%p]
[142][name]Itaru[line]“Wh-what!?”[%p]
[143][name]Itaru[line]“Wait, that’s absurd.”[%p]
[144][name]Rintaro[line]“How else could it have vanished? The microwave was closed!”[%p]
[145][name]Itaru[line]“Um, maybe we should just calm down.”[%p]
[146][name]Rintaro[line]“Y-yeah. You’re right...”[%p]
[147]We each take a deep breath.[%p]
[148]Oh, I know. I’ll eat one of the remaining bananas. That will calm me down.[%p]
[149]I reach for the bunch of bananas.[%p]
[150][name]Rintaro[line]“What... the...!?”[%p]
[151]Impossible.[%p]
[152]Impossible![%p]
[153]Not three minutes ago, Daru plucked a banana from the bunch and put it inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
[154]But now, there’s no sign that a banana was ever plucked.[%p]
[155]Instead, a single gelified banana has appeared among the regular bananas.[%p]
[156][name]Itaru[line]“Oh shit! What the hell’s going on?”[%p]
[157]Daru notices it too.[%p]
[158]He reaches out to touch it, but I quickly stop him.[%p]
[159][name]Rintaro[line]“Wait! How many bananas are in the lab right now!?”[%p]
[160][name]Itaru[line]“J-just these, I think...”[%p]
[161][name]Rintaro[line]“Is this gelbana attached to the same stem as the banana you just picked?”[%p]
[162][name]Itaru[line]“I dunno, man... I wasn’t paying attention.”[%p]
[163][name]Itaru[line]“It doesn’t look like it was ever plucked...”[%p]
[164]No cuts or anything.[%p]
[165]Aside from the gelification, it looks completely normal.[%p]
[166][name]Rintaro[line]“H-hey, Daru... could this possibly be...”[%p]
[167]The word I spoke impulsively a few seconds ago.[%p]
[168]I hesitate to speak it again.[%p]
[169]But I must.[%p]
[170]Because no matter how unbelievable it may be, we saw it with our own eyes![%p]
[171]My head’s full of question marks. I don’t know how this happened. But if I were to explain it as I saw it...[%p]
[172]The banana that was inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change) returned instantly to its bunch. In other words...[%p]
[173][name]Rintaro[line]“A teleporter... we’ve invented a teleporter!”[%p]
