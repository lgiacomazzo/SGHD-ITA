[0]In any case, there’s nothing we can do about it now. It’s time for Daru and I to head to [color index="820000"]Daibiru[color index="800000"].[%p]
[1]There’s going to be a seminar at [color index="820000"]ATF[color index="800000"], and we have to be there. It’s part of our studies at Tokyo Denki University.[%p]
[2]Summer credits, basically. We have to attend the seminar and write a report.[%p]
[3]Come to think of it, what’s today’s seminar about, again?[%p]
[4]I looked it up before the summer holiday began. I should have written it down.[%p]
[5][name]Female Reporter[line]“Behind me is the large, unidentified object that crashed into a building near Akihabara Station!”[%p]
[6][name]Female Reporter[line]“The building is under police barricade. No one is allowed to approach, but from a distance, the object appears to be some kind of satellite!”[%p]
[7]As we cross the overpass that connects UPX and Daibiru, I look down to see a huge crowd of people moving through the plaza.[%p]
[8]There are even some garishly dressed young men and women, the sort you don’t usually see around Akiba.[%p]
[9]Everyone is walking towards the main street, which is still cordoned off.[%p]
[10][name]Rintaro[line]“Daru, aren’t you going to check out Radi-Kan?”[%p]
[11][name]Itaru[line]“No point. Can’t get close. I’ve been following the news online, though. There’s already a hundred threads about it on @channel. It’s huge, man.”[%p]
[12]Oh, so that’s why he was staring at his phone earlier.[%p]
[13]We enter Daibiru and take the elevator to the 5th floor ATF assembly hall.[%p]
[14][name]Itaru[line]“Man, feel that AC! I’m alive!”[%p]
[15]Unlike the lab, Daibiru has air conditioning. Yet another reason for our diligent participation in the seminar.[%p]
[16][name]Rintaro[line]“About the PhoneWave (name subject to change). I might have found our answer.”[%p]
[17][name]Itaru[line]“You know, that ’(name subject to change)’ thing is really annoying.”[%p]
[18]I won’t give in that easily. Even if no other lab members use ’(name subject to change)’, I will carry on until the day we decide its true name.[%p]
[19][name]Rintaro[line]“Now’s not the time.”[%p]
[20][name]Itaru[line]“So, what’s your latest ridiculous theory?”[%p]
[21][name]Rintaro[line]“What do you mean, ridiculous? My genius brain considers [color index="A0140000"]every[color index="800000"] possibility, even those a lesser mind would say break the laws of nature. Don’t you dare call that ridiculous.”[%p]
[22][name]Itaru[line]“So basically, you’re just pulling stuff outta your ass. You can’t call that science.”[%p]
[23][name]Rintaro[line]“Daru. I have a hunch that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) may be the key to opening Steins Gate. How’s that?”[%p]
[24][name]Itaru[line]“Steins what? You lost me back at ’ridiculous’, man.”[%p]
[25]A chime signals our arrival on the 5th floor.[%p]
[26]The elevator doors open slowly.[%p]
[27]As we step out of the elevator--[%p]
[28][name]???[line]“Ah!”[%p]
[29]I bump into someone.[%p]
[30]I quickly grab the person’s shoulder to keep them from falling.[%p]
[31][name]???[line]“I’m sorry!”[%p]
[32][name]Rintaro[line]“Wha...!?”[%p]
[33]It’s a girl.[%p]
[34]And I recognize her.[%p]
[35][name]Rintaro[line]“You... you...!”[%p]
[36]Impossible.[%p]
[37]Chills run down my spine.[%p]
[38]I stare at her face in disbelief.[%p]
[39]I saw this girl just three hours ago.[%p]
[40]Makise Kurisu![%p]
[41][name]Kurisu[line]“Is there something wrong?”[%p]
[42]Kurisu frowns and tries to back away.[%p]
[43]But I don’t let go of her shoulder.[%p]
[44]My grip tightens.[%p]
[45][name]Kurisu[line]“O-ow!”[%p]
[46][name]Rintaro[line]“Y-you...”[%p]
[47][name]Rintaro[line]“You should be dead! Why are you here!?”[%p]
[48][name]Rintaro[line]“And you’re even...”[%p]
[49]There isn’t a single bloodstain on her clothes, and they’re the same ones she was wearing when I found her.[%p]
[50]Only a serious wound could have produced that much blood.[%p]
[51]Yet as far as I can tell, she’s completely uninjured.[%p]
[52][name]Rintaro[line]“Not a scratch...”[%p]
[53][name]Kurisu[line]“Hey, that hurts! Let me go!”[%p]
[54]Kurisu pushes me away.[%p]
[55]Then she shoots me a wary glare.[%p]
[56]I realize that I’m gaping in disbelief.[%p]
[57][name]Kurisu[line]“What’s wrong with you?”[%p]
[58][name]Rintaro[line]“You’re okay? But that’s impossible! Someone stabbed you! I saw you lying in a pool of blood!”[%p]
[59][name]Itaru[line]“That again?”[%p]
[60]Daru interrupts.[%p]
[61]Wait. There’s something strange about what he just said.[%p]
[62][name]Rintaro[line]“What do you mean, ’again’?”[%p]
[63][name]Itaru[line]“I mean, you sent me that email like a week ago, right?”[%p]
[64][name]Rintaro[line]“I sent you an email?”[%p]
[65][name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t be ridiculous! I saw her dead just three hours ago!”[%p]
[66][name]Kurisu[line]“Hey! Could you not talk about me like that? I’m perfectly fine.”[%p]
[67][name]Itaru[line]“You know, that message was kinda weird. It was dated a week after I got it, which means it came from the future.”[%p]
[68][name]Kurisu[line]“It came from the future?”[%p]
[69][name]Rintaro[line]“That sounds like something you’d read on the internet, Daru. It’s rare for you to talk about ridiculous theories.”[%p]
[70][name]Itaru[line]“No, the date was definitely a week later. It came from, uh... the 28th. Wait. That’s today!”[%p]
[71]Daru pulls out his phone and shows it to me.[%p]
[72]He’s right. The email was sent from my phone.[%p]
[73]He received it on July 21st at 12:56.[%p]
[74]But it was sent on July 28th at 12:54.[%p]
[75]It was split into three mails.[%p]
[76]“Someone stab”[%p]
[77]“bed Makise K”[%p]
[78]“urisu. Don’t”[%p]
[79]Why did I send such a short message in three parts?[%p]
[80]And it looks like the third email got cut off.[%p]
[81]I do recognize the content, though.[%p]
[82][name]Rintaro[line]“This is the email I sent you three hours ago.”[%p]
[83]But I sent one mail. Not three. And there should be more text.[%p]
[84]Did Daru really get this a week ago?[%p]
[85][name]Kurisu[line]“Interesting...”[%p]
[86]Suddenly, Kurisu is standing next to me, peering intently at the screen of Daru’s phone.[%p]
[87]Oh, right! The email’s not important! Well, maybe it is, but not right now![%p]
[88]The real question is why she’s still alive![%p]
[89]Is she an illusion!? No, an evil spirit!? Am I haunted!?[%p]
[90]I don’t believe in such unscientific drivel! I am a mad scientist![%p]
[91]I timidly reach out to Kurisu’s face...[%p]
[92]My fingertips stroke her hair.[%p]
[93]Feels silky. Quite the cuticles.[%p]
[94][name]Rintaro[line]“Substance. She has substance. Of course she’s not a ghost. How silly of me.”[%p]
[95][name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[96][name]Itaru[line]“O-Okarin, I don’t think that’s a good idea...”[%p]
[97]I poke Kurisu’s cheeks with my fingers.[%p]
[98]Such softness. Dead bodies don’t feel like this. Not that I’ve ever touched one.[%p]
[99][name]Kurisu[line]“...Hey.”[%p]
[100]Wait a minute, we already touched when I bumped into her coming out of the elevator. I even grabbed her shoulders before being pushed away.[%p]
[101]And I still doubted that she had substance? That’s just proof of how confused I am.[%p]
[102]If she’s alive, then what did I see back at Radi-Kan? What was that scream I heard?[%p]
[103]Were they hallucinations, just like that mass disappearance?[%p]
[104]That’s right, she was stabbed! Maybe she’s just hiding her wounds.[%p]
[105]This requires further investigation.[%p]
[106]I grab the hem of her blouse and slowly lift it--[%p]
[107][name]Kurisu[line]“Are you trying to get yourself arrested?”[%p]
[108][name]Rintaro[line]“I just want to know the truth.”[%p]
[109]I stare straight back at Kurisu as she trembles with anger, and lift her blouse a little higher...[%p]
[110][name]Kurisu[line]“What truth, you perv!? You stupid!? Wanna die!?”[%p]
[111]She pushes my hand away.[%p]
[112][name]Itaru[line]“[color index="820000"]Louise-chan[color index="800000"]’s famous line for the win!”[%p]
[113]Daru shouts something silly, but I ignore him and press Kurisu.[%p]
[114][name]Rintaro[line]“I know what I saw!”[%p]
[115][name]Kurisu[line]“No way! Did you just see my underw...!?”[%p]
[116]Kurisu’s face turns bright red. She firmly pulls her blouse down.[%p]
[117][name]Rintaro[line]“No, you fool! Not that!”[%p]
[118][name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[119]Earlier this afternoon, after Doctor Nakabachi’s presentation, someone killed Makise Kurisu and left her in a pool of blood.[%p]
[120]I carefully explain everything that I saw.[%p]
[121][name]Kurisu[line]“Wait. Doctor Nakabachi?”[%p]
[122][name]Itaru[line]“What are you talking about, Okarin? Doctor Nakabachi’s presentation was canceled.”[%p]
[123][name]Rintaro[line]“Canceled!?”[%p]
[124][name]Itaru[line]“Yeah. Because of the satellite crash.”[%p]
[125]Something’s wrong. Our stories aren’t matching.[%p]
[126]It’s the same thing that happened right after I saw the mass disappearance. Mayuri’s story didn’t match mine.[%p]
[127]I need to know.[%p]
[128]Am I caught in some sinister plot?[%p]
[129]Is this another Organization conspiracy?[%p]
[130][name]Kurisu[line]“Excuse me, um...”[%p]
[131][name]Rintaro[line]“My name... is Hououin Kyouma!”[%p]
[132][name]Itaru[line]“Really, man? You’re hopeless...”[%p]
[133][name]Kurisu[line]“Okay, Hououin-[color index="820000"]san[color index="800000"]. I’d like to hear your story in more detail.”[%p]
[134]Looks like she finally understands I’m not lying.[%p]
[135]But I still don’t understand why my memories don’t match everyone else’s. I doubt that I can give her a good explanation.[%p]
[136]Just then, an older man steps out of the assembly hall.[%p]
[137][name]Professor[line]“Makise-san? It’s almost time.”[%p]
[138][name]Kurisu[line]“Huh? Oh, right. Thank you.”[%p]
[139]Kurisu glances at me one more time, then sighs and heads towards the small conference room.[%p]
[140][name]Itaru[line]“We should go too.”[%p]
[141][name]Rintaro[line]“Go where?”[%p]
[142][name]Itaru[line]“To hear the lecture, duh?”[%p]
[143]Ahh, that.[%p]
[144]Daru follows after Kurisu.[%p]
[145]Did she come to attend the lecture too? Strange.[%p]
[146]Why would the girl genius, Makise Kurisu, need to attend a lecture like this?[%p]
