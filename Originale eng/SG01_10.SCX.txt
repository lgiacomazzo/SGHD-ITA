[0][name]Maids[line][center]”Welcome back, Myaster!”[%p]
[1]I open the door to the MayQueen+Nyan² maid cafe, and two familiar cat-eared girls greet me with smiles.[%p]
[2][name]Mayuri[line]“It’s Okarin!”[%p]
[3]One of them is Mayuri.[%p]
[4]But here, she’s called Mayushii NyanNyan.[%p]
[5]Since she works here, I stop by about twice a month.[%p]
[6]I guess that would make me a regular customer.[%p]
[7]Actually, I’ve never been to any other maid cafe.[%p]
[8][name]Mayuri[line]“Welcome back, Okarin.”[%p]
[9]After bowing again, Mayuri gasps as if she thought of something.[%p]
[10][name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, Okarin! Mayushii just noticed something.”[%p]
[11][name]Mayuri[line]“’Welcome back’ and ’Okarin’ go really well together!”[%p]
[12]Whatever...[%p]
[13][name]Faris[line]“Kyouma! It’s great that you came, nya!”[%p]
[14]The other maid who came to greet me, Faris NyanNyan -- her professional name, of course -- hits me with her trademark combo attack of cute cat-like gestures.[%p]
[15]She’s MayQueen+Nyan²’s most popular maid.[%p]
[16]Even though she and Mayuri are about the same age, she looks and acts a bit younger.[%p]
[17][name]Faris[line]“Daru-nyan’s here too. He’s been waiting, nya.”[%p]
[18]Daru frequents this cafe because he’s got a crush on Faris.[%p]
[19]He often reads her public blog while muttering, “Faris, you’re so cute,” to himself. He’s got it real bad.[%p]
[20]I keep telling him to choose either 2D or 3D, but he doesn’t listen.[%p]
[21]I also have trouble dealing with this catgirl.[%p]
[22]She always finds a way to best me.[%p]
[23][name]Faris[line]“Are you holding another secret meeting to overthrow the evil Organization, nya?”[%p]
[24][name]Rintaro[line]“Uh, yeah, something like that.”[%p]
[25][name]Faris[line]“Faris wants to join too, nya!”[%p]
[26][name]Rintaro[line]“No chance. The Organization isn’t threatened by cat-eared maids.”[%p]
[27][name]Faris[line]“Not true, nya. Faris has the purrfect secret technique to help take them down.”[%p]
[28][name]Rintaro[line]“What!? You’ve finally mastered [color index="A0140000"]that[color index="800000"] secret technique!?”[%p]
[29][name]Faris[line]“Yes, nya... After completing my pilgrimage to the Guiana Highlands and overcoming my mentor’s death, I finally mastered it.”[%p]
[30]What mentor...[%p]
[31]Faris knows my true name, Hououin Kyouma. I’ve also told her all about the Organization.[%p]
[32]And now she’s more into it that I am. She’s always the one to bring up the subject whenever we meet.[%p]
[33]By the way, this the first time I’ve heard of this ’secret technique’, or whatever it is.[%p]
[34][name]Faris[line]“So Faris wants to participate in the Spirit Conference like you promised, nya!”[%p]
[35]Ugh... she’s not letting it go.[%p]
[36]It’ll take 30 minutes if I play along with her.[%p]
[37][name]Rintaro[line]“You’re not suggesting we venture to the Sanctuary!?”[%p]
[38][name]Rintaro[line]“The answer is no. Although you may understand the Hidden Secrets, you’re still too inexperienced.”[%p]
[39][name]Faris[line]“But... but you promised, nya! Are you going to betray me!?”[%p]
[40][name]Faris[line]“My brother is waiting for me there...”[%p]
[41]Since when do you have a brother!? And what the hell’s this Spirit Conference anyway?[%p]
[42]Faris looks at me with actual tears in her eyes.[%p]
[43]I falter, even though I know it’s just one of her cutesy acts.[%p]
[44]Whenever I talk with her, I run out of comebacks, which is really unusual for me.[%p]
[45]And then she takes the initiative, leaving me with nothing to do but listen to her fantasies.[%p]
[46]I mean, come on, you can only take it so far.[%p]
[47]There’s a very clear difference between her stories and mine.[%p]
[48]As anyone can see, I speak nothing but the truth, while Faris has only delusions and a made-up backstory![%p]
[49]I always have to play along.[%p]
[50]That’s why I feel like I can never best her.[%p]
[51][name]Mayuri[line]“Umm, I don’t quite get it, but can Mayushii go to the Sanctuary too?”[%p]
[52]Great, now look who’s joined in.[%p]
[53]It’s just going to get worse from here.[%p]
[54]I have to end this conversation now![%p]
[55][name]Rintaro[line]“You can’t come. This discussion is over.”[%p]
[56][name]Mayuri[line]“Ehhh?”[%p]
[57][name]Faris[line]“No fair, Kyouma!”[%p]
[58][name]Mayuri[line]“That’s right! Leaving Mayushii and Feris-chan behind is mean!”[%p]
[59][name]Rintaro[line]“...Who’s is ’Feris’?”[%p]
[60][name]Mayuri[line]“Feris-chan is Feris-chan. Right?”[%p]
[61][name]Faris[line]“Right!”[%p]
[62]Mayuri and Faris look at each other and smile.[%p]
[63]Is she talking about this Faris? Is that her real name? Have I been mistaken all this time?[%p]
[64]That’s a disturbing thought...[%p]
[65][name]Mayuri[line]“Well, Mayushii has a hard time saying Faris, so I call her Feris-chan instead!”[%p]
[66][name]Rintaro[line]“Oh, so that’s it.”[%p]
[67][name]Faris[line]“It’s like we’re in a girl’s school. That’s not too... [color index="A0140000"]tabby[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[68]Ok then. Moving on...[%p]
[69][name]Rintaro[line]“Show me to the table already. How long do you want me to stand here waiting?”[%p]
[70][name]Faris[line]“Nyahaha! Sorry, nya. Table for two, this way, nyan♪”[%p]
[71][name]Faris[line]“Mayushii, I’ll leave it to you, nyan nyan.”[%p]
[72][name]Mayuri[line]“Leave it to me, nyan nyan♪”[%p]
[73]If you hadn’t noticed, the cat-eared maids here at MayQueen+Nyan² are required to add cat sounds -- nyas and nyans -- to their words with some frequency.[%p]
[74]Mayuri takes my hand and leads me inside.[%p]
[75]Apparently, Mayushii NyanNyan is the only one who leads customers by the hand like this.[%p]
[76]It probably comes naturally to her. She doesn’t even realize the effect it has on her customers. And that’s why she’s second to Faris in popularity at this maid cafe.[%p]
[77]She guides me to Daru’s table.[%p]
[78]The tables are about 60% full.[%p]
[79]Among Akiba’s maid cafes, MayQueen+Nyan²’s popularity is solid, but not booming. [%p]
[80]Considering what Faris and the others are wearing, it’s more like a cosplay cafe than a maid cafe.[%p]
[81]Furthermore, the cat ears and NyanNyanian dialect makes it less accessible to low-level otaku and first timers.[%p]
[82]On the other hand, those same cat ears are a topic of heated debate among die-hard maid cafe fans.[%p]
[83][margin top="19456"]“Maids don’t have cat ears!”[%e]
[84][margin top="29184"][margin left="-3071"]“Cat Ears + Maid = 2X Moe!”[%e]
[85]These two viewpoints clash.[%p]
[86]This place is one of the older maid cafes in Akihabara, but it doesn’t get much media exposure. Maybe that’s what makes it more comfortable than most.[%p]
[87]At least, that’s what Daru says.[%p]
[88]He talks about this stuff so much that it’s been burned into my synapses.[%p]
[89][name]Mayuri[line]“Daru-kun, Okarin is here, nyan.”[%p]
[90][name]Itaru[line]“You’re way late. Seriously, man.”[%p]
[91]Daru sits in front of me, but doesn’t look my way.[%p]
[92]He looks upset for some reason.[%p]
[93][name]Itaru[line]“So, what were you just talking about with Faris? I want details.”[%p]
[94][name]Rintaro[line]“...You really want to know? I don’t think you’d understand it.”[%p]
[95]Hell, even I didn’t get most of it.[%p]
[96][name]Itaru[line]“Ah, the usual...”[%p]
[97][name]Itaru[line]“Your conversations are too much for regular otaku. You guys exude an aura or something, you know?”[%p]
[98][name]Itaru[line]“It’s like you too have your own [color index="820000"]Reality Marble[color index="800000"]! You know I can’t forgive you!”[%p]
[99][name]Mayuri[line]“I think Feris-chan likes Okarin, nya.”[%p]
[100][name]Mayuri[line]“Of all the maids and masters here, nya, the only one who can keep up with Feris-chan is you, Okarin.”[%p]
[101]I’m not even close to keeping up with her.[%p]
[102][name]Itaru[line]“I’m so jealous! You lucky bastard!”[%p]
[103][name]Rintaro[line]“Hmph, I have no interest in women who dress themselves in lies.”[%p]
[104][name]Itaru[line]“Like you’re one to talk.”[%p]
[105][name]Rintaro[line]“Silence, you unfaithful bastard! All your 2D wives are crying.”[%p]
[106][name]Itaru[line]“Gwahh, you struck a nerve, man...”[%p]
[107]Daru theatrically grabs his chest and falls onto the table.[%p]
[108]I sip from one of the glasses of water that Mayuri brought to our table.[%p]
[109][name]Mayuri[line]“Master, may I take your order, nya?”[%p]
[110][name]Rintaro[line]“Omelet rice. And hot coffee. Black.”[%p]
[111][name]Mayuri[line]“Coming right up, nyan nyan♪”[%p]
[112]After taking my order, Mayuri finds her way towards the counter as if swimming between the rows of tables.[%p]
[113]I hope she doesn’t trip.[%p]
[114][name]Itaru[line]“So, what did you need?”[%p]
[115]Daru asks without getting up from the table.[%p]
[116]That’s right.[%p]
[117]In my confrontations with Shining Finger and Catgirl, I almost forgot my original objective.[%p]
[118][name]Itaru[line]“I was gonna head to the lab in about an hour.”[%p]
[119][name]Rintaro[line]“I have an urgent matter to discuss. Top secret.”[%p]
[120]I lean on the table and scan the area without moving my head.[%p]
[121][name]Rintaro[line]“You remember John Titor?”[%p]
[122][name]Itaru[line]“...John Titor? Who’s that?”[%p]
[123][name]Rintaro[line]“The self-proclaimed time traveler who appeared on the internet about 10 years ago. I thought we talked about him before.”[%p]
[124][name]Itaru[line]“Is this a new addition to your made-up backstory?”[%p]
[125][name]Rintaro[line]“It’s nothing like that! Everything I say is the truth!”[%p]
[126][name]Itaru[line]“What a pain. Well, I guess I can play along.”[%p]
[127][name]Itaru[line]“So, what’s the source on this Titor guy being from the future?”[%p]
[128][name]Rintaro[line]“Wait, you’ve seriously never heard about him before?”[%p]
[129][name]Itaru[line]“Seriously, bro, I haven’t.”[%p]
[130][name]Rintaro[line]“Sure you didn’t just forget?”[%p]
[131][name]Itaru[line]“I can’t say for sure.”[%p]
[132][name]Rintaro[line]“There are even books about him.”[%p]
[133][name]Itaru[line]“I might remember if you show me one.”[%p]
[134][name]Rintaro[line]“You really don’t remember?”[%p]
[135][name]Itaru[line]“Memories fade. We’re not computers, man.”[%p]
[136][name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[137]This is wrong.[%p]
[138]I remember talking to Daru about John Titor back in high school. It was only idle talk, so it’s possible that Daru forgot about it.[%p]
[139]Daru is quite the internet addict, but the internet lets you choose what information you want to see. There’s no guarantee Daru looked up info on John Titor.[%p]
[140]If he had, I doubt he would have forgotten so completely.[%p]
[141]Is it my memories that are mistaken, or everyone else’s?[%p]
[142][name]Rintaro[line]“Then what about the IBN 5100?”[%p]
[143][name]Itaru[line]“Woah, you know about that? Cool.”[%p]
[144][name]Rintaro[line]“So you know about it?”[%p]
[145][name]Itaru[line]“It’s the model IBN released back in 1975.”[%p]
[146]Right. That’s what John Titor said on @channel.[%p]
[147]He traveled to 1975 first, obtained an IBN 5100, then leaped to 1998.[%p]
[148][name]Rintaro[line]“What kind of computer is it?”[%p]
[149][name]Itaru[line]“The stupidly expensive kind.”[%p]
[150][name]Itaru[line]“Back when it came out, computers were so expensive that average people couldn’t get their hands on them.”[%p]
[151][name]Itaru[line]“It was full of proprietary IBN technology, and was a pretty powerful computer for its time.”[%p]
[152][name]Itaru[line]“Then six years later, in 1981, IBN launched the popular IBN PC series. Now that’s more famous.”[%p]
[153][name]Itaru[line]“Anyway, it’s not like I’m an expert. This is just stuff I read on a [color index="820000"]wiki[color index="800000"].”[%p]
[154][name]Rintaro[line]“Have you heard the urban legend that there’s one in Akiba?”[%p]
[155][name]Itaru[line]“You bet I have. Just last month there was big talk about it on the net.”[%p]
[156][name]Itaru[line]“Some @channelers heard the rumors and went searching for it. My friend on [color index="820000"]FrePara[color index="800000"], Sister Centipede, was the main person behind that.”[%p]
[157][name]Itaru[line]“Even the legendary ’Neidhardt der Blitzschnelle’ joined the fray, but they still couldn’t find it.”[%p]
[158][name]Rintaro[line]“So it was just a hoax?”[%p]
[159][name]Itaru[line]“Who knows? There are tons of underground shops in Akiba. It wouldn’t be strange if an IBN 5100 suddenly turned up in some hole in the wall.”[%p]
[160][name]Rintaro[line]“Hmm. I see.”[%p]
[161]My phone suddenly starts vibrating.[%p]
[162]It stops after about 3 seconds.[%p]
[163]Looks like I got mail.[%p]
[164]I can check it whenever I want, but...[%p]
[165]I’m talking to Daru now, so it can probably wait.[%p]
[166]Oh come on...[%p]
[167]What’s with this mail?[%p]
[168]Disregarding the weird timing...[%p]
[169]Is this really the gloomy, unsociable woman I met in front of Radi-Kan?[%p]
[170]She’s like a completely different person in this email. Does she have split personalities or something?[%p]
[171]Hmmm... well, I got some info about the IBN 5100, so I guess I should give her a reply.[%p]
[172]But if I send an immediate reply to a woman I just met, won’t I come off as clingy and desperate?[%p]
[173]I, Hououin Kyouma, will not be taken lightly.[%p]
[174]This is my chance to make her understand which one of us is the superior human being.[%p]
[175]And above all, I have yet to ascertain if she can be trusted.[%p]
[176]She might start harassing me if I reply the wrong way.[%p]
[177]And besides, she hasn’t proven that she’s not working for the Organization.[%p]
[178]Nonetheless, it couldn’t hurt to tell her what I learned from Daru.[%p]
[179]To discourage her, of course. Muhahaha![%p]
[180]I tell Daru to wait a bit as I start typing out a response.[%p]
[181]It’s not like I trust her, but I figure I should tell her what I learned from Daru.[%p]
[182]And then she’ll be completely discouraged. Muhahaha![%p]
[183]Ok, sent.[%p]
[184]What!?[%p]
[185]A response already!?[%p]
[186]Hardly any time lag!?[%p]
[187]As always, Shining Finger, your digits defy the laws of physics.[%p]
[188]I start reading the mail.[%p]
[189]Oh, dammit![%p]
[190]Just as I thought, that woman has a predisposition for harassment.[%p]
[191]I never should have gotten involved with her.[%p]
[192]Let’s not reply to this one.[%p]
[193]I’ve fulfilled my minimum obligation. I have nothing to feel guilty about.[%p]
[194][name]Rintaro[line]“Sorry for the wait, Daru.”[%p]
[195]Let’s ignore it.[%p]
[196]This is out of kindness. Mmhmm.[%p]
[197][name]Rintaro[line]“Sorry for the wait, Daru.”[%p]
[198][name]Rintaro[line]“So, there’s one thing I need to know.”[%p]
[199]I scan the area with my eyes once more. Then I lean in close.[%p]
[200][name]Rintaro[line]“The IBN 5100 has the power to destroy the world, right?”[%p]
[201][name]Itaru[line]“What? It doesn’t have the power to do anything, let alone destroy the damn world.”[%p]
[202][name]Faris[line]“What this, nya? The world’s gonna be destroyed, nya?”[%p]
[203]Faris brings my omelet rice.[%p]
[204]She’s doing her cat-like gestures while keeping her tray balanced on one hand. True feline agility.[%p]
[205]Despite her NyanNyanian nonsense, Faris is the consummate professional.[%p]
[206][name]Faris[line]“Master, thanks for waiting nyan nyan♪ Omelet rice, nyan!”[%p]
[207]The catgirl puts the omelet rice on the table and then takes a bottle of ketchup from her apron pocket.[%p]
[208]She uses it to write “THE WORLD IS DOOMED!!” in red letters upon the omelet’s blank yellow canvas.[%p]
[209][name]Faris[line]“Please enjoy your meal before the world ends♪”[%p]
[210][name]Itaru[line]“Woah, ’The World is Doomed!!’ for the win! Faris’s handwriting is so cute it puts my ’omelet’ in danger too!”[%p]
[211]It appears the cuteness has shattered Daru’s sanity.[%p]
[212]I give him a look that says ’calm down’, but to no avail.[%p]
[213]I smooth out the ketchup with the bottom of my spoon, erasing the ketchup words.[%p]
[214][name]Itaru[line]“Ahh... what a waste...”[%p]
[215]I’m going to eat it either way.[%p]
[216][name]Faris[line]“Daru-nyan, Daru-nyan, have you considered participating in the Faris Cup, nya?”[%p]
[217][name]Itaru[line]“Yeah, of course I’m participating!”[%p]
[218][name]Rintaro[line]“Faris Cup? What’s that?”[%p]
[219]I take a mouthful of omelet rice.[%p]
[220][name]Faris[line]“Next Sunday, we’re hosting a RaiNet tournament at the cafe, nya!”[%p]
[221]Faris starts dancing in place.[%p]
[222]I’d prefer she not jump around like that when people are eating nearby.[%p]
[223][name]Faris[line]“Faris is the event organizer. It’s all my idea, nyan!”[%p]
[224][name]Faris[line]“You can participate too if you want, Kyouma! Entrance fee is 1000 yen and includes a drink. Whoever beats Faris gets to enjoy some of Faris’ home-cooking, nya.”[%p]
[225][name]Itaru[line]“It’ll never happen. Okarin sucks at RaiNet.”[%p]
[226][name]Faris[line]“Nya? But it’s so fun.”[%p]
[227][name]Rintaro[line]“No, I’m fine...”[%p]
[228]I stop shoveling the omelet rice into my mouth. Then I deliver a melancholy sigh.[%p]
[229][name]Rintaro[line]“RaiNet AccessBattlers, huh... Whenever I hear that name, I remember the former champion... Has it already been two years?”[%p]
[230][name]Rintaro[line]“No, it’s nothing. Forget what I said.”[%p]
[231][name]Faris[line]“NyaNya? That sounded so serious, nya! Who was the former champion, nya?”[%p]
[232][name]Itaru[line]”He probably doesn’t exist. I mean, RaiNet didn’t even have official tournaments until about a year ago.[%p]
[233][name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[234][name]Faris[line]“Kyouma... you still can’t forget him, can you, nya?”[%p]
[235][name]Rintaro[line]“What?”[%p]
[236][name]Faris[line]“I remember that you and the champion -- my brother -- were such good friends, Kyouma. You were so close it made me jealous, nya.”[%p]
[237]Dammit. She took my story and ran with it again![%p]
[238]I never even said anything about him being her brother![%p]
[239]Hell, I don’t know if Faris even has siblings![%p]
[240]I shouldn’t have talked about stuff like this in front of Faris![%p]
[241][name]Faris[line]“But it’s time to let go of the past! Seize the day with your own paws!”[%p]
[242]Her shout resounds throughout the store. Her finger snaps at me.[%p]
[243][name]Faris[line]“Even though it’s painful... no, [color index="A0140000"]because[color index="800000"] it’s painful, I succeeded my brother’s dying wish and purrfected my skills as a RaiNetter, nya!”[%p]
[244][name]Faris[line]“Do you remember, nya? He always used to say, ’Some day, let’s bring peace to the world with RaiNet--’”[%p]
[245][name]Rintaro[line]“Faris, bring me my coffee.”[%p]
[246][name]Faris[line]“NyaNya?”[%p]
[247]I present my empty plate to Faris.[%p]
[248]I always eat quickly. It’s a habit I picked up naturally during my years on the run from the Organization.[%p]
[249]Screw the [color index="820000"]slow food[color index="800000"] trend.[%p]
[250][name]Faris[line]“Sure thing, Master! Just a moment, nya♪”[%p]
[251]Faris takes the dish and heads back to the counter.[%p]
[252]Whew... if I’d left things going as they were, I would’ve had to play along for another 10 minutes in her fantasy world.[%p]
[253][name]Itaru[line]“Faris is one of the most skilled Rainetters I know.”[%p]
[254]Daru explains with a wry smile.[%p]
[255][name]Itaru[line]“She’s gone undefeated in over 400 unofficial matches.”[%p]
[256][name]Rintaro[line]“Is she Rickson Gracie?”[%p]
[257]Daru ignores my perfect retort.[%p]
[258][name]Itaru[line]“It’s so disappointing that Faris doesn’t go to official tournaments. She’d win if she did, no doubt.”[%p]
[259][name]Rintaro[line]“Why doesn’t she?”[%p]
[260][name]Itaru[line]“I’m sure it’s for the customers! She probably doesn’t want to inconvenience the store. Truly a model maid.”[%p]
[261][name]Itaru[line]“Also, she’s Mayushii’s age, so she probably has school too.”[%p]
[262][name]Rintaro[line]“She doesn’t want to inconvenience the store, yet she’s holding the Faris Cup here?”[%p]
[263][name]Itaru[line]“That doesn’t matter at all!”[%p]
[264][name]Itaru[line]“The point is, Faris is cute, and cuteness is justice. Cute cat-eared maids are sweet, if you know what I mean. And that’s all that matters, right?”[%p]
[265][name]Rintaro[line]“So in the end, do you bat for the 2D team, or the 3D team?”[%p]
[266][name]Itaru[line]“I dare say I’m bi!”[%p]
[267][name]Rintaro[line]”You’re an inspiration, Daru.” [%p]
[268][name]Itaru[line]“I know. I’m just too awesome.”[%p]
[269]Daru usually doesn’t show enthusiasm for anything. The exceptions are moe and Faris.[%p]
[270]I wish he were this passionate about our experiments.[%p]
