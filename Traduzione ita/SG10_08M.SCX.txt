[name]Rintaro[line]“The time has come. We will now commence the final phase of Operation Verthandi.”[%p]
Mayuri and Daru turn to me and nod.[%p]
Today is the last day of ComiMa. Daru wanted to attend, of course, but a little begging convinced him to prioritize the operation.[%p]
I take a look around the lab.[%p]
These twenty days have seen constant change. It’s incredible to think that at one point, this lab had a whole eight members.[%p]
And now we’re back to three.[%p]
The memories we made.[%p]
The experiences we shared.[%p]
To save Mayuri, I will undo them all.[%p]
There is sorrow in me. And guilt.[%p]
I engrave them deep inside my heart.[%p]
I’ll never forget -- I mustn’t forget -- these long, yet short summer days.[%p]
But still, I choose to erase our memories. I choose to return everything to normal.[%p]
Suzuha’s mission is irrelevant. I’m not doing this for the future.[%p]
As long as Mayuri lives, nothing else matters.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru. You may begin.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“...You sure?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okey-dokey!”[%p]
Daru starts typing on the IBN 5100. It’s already connected to his main computer.[%p]
This will get us into SERN’s central database, where they keep the data they mine with Echelon.[%p]
There we will locate the first D-Mail I sent on July 28th, and erase all trace of its existence.[%p]
With this, I can reach the Beta worldline.[%p]
At last, Mayuri will be safe.[%p]
I look at Mayuri. She’s on the couch, sitting straight as a ramrod, with her grandmother’s pocket watch pressed to her ear. She stays still, with her eyes closed.[%p]
Whenever Mayuri wants to calm down, she listens to the sound of that pocket watch.[%p]
Ever since we parted with Kurisu, Mayuri has said nothing about my choice.[%p]
I guess she’s come to terms with it, in her own way.[%p]
The actual work, I’ve left to Daru. No problem there.[%p]
While waiting for him to finish, I walk into the development room.[%p]
In the center of the room is the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
I squat down and gently brush my fingers against the microwave’s surface.[%p]
It’s cool to the touch.[%p]
I’ve made irreplaceable friends because of this thing. And because of this thing, I’ve hurt them.[%p]
But I don’t want to blame the tool.[%p]
It’s how you use the tool that matters.[%p]
And I’ve got to admit, it’s saved me more than once.[%p]
But still.[%p]
Once this is over, I’ll destroy the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
We must never make the same mistakes again.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okarin, I found it! It’s really there!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The D-Mail I sent? It’s there!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It sure is, man.”[%p]
Daru points to a string of characters.[%p]
My name is there, followed by the message I wrote about Kurisu’s death.[%p]
Three lines total, each twelve characters long.[%p]
This data led SERN to our doorstep.[%p]
At FB’s instruction, Moeka and the Rounders attacked.[%p]
If Suzuha is right, then by erasing this data, we will escape from Attractor Field Alpha, where SERN dominates the future.[%p]
That will take us to Attractor Field Beta.[%p]
To the Beta worldline within its range of convergence.[%p]
To a future without Mayuri’s death.[%p]
Mayuri is standing next to me, gazing intently at the monitor.[%p]
She grasps my hand firmly.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s okay.”[%p]
She looks anxious, so I pat her head to calm her down.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Everything’s set. One press of the enter key, and that data’s gone.”[%p]
Daru stands up and gestures to the open seat.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I leave that honor to you, Okarin.”[%p]
I sit down and face the keyboard.[%p]
This time.[%p]
This time, it ends.[%p]
Kurisu’s face floats through my mind.[%p]
I close my eyes and take a deep breath.[%p]
...Goodbye, Kurisu.[%p]
I slowly raise my right hand.[%p]
And extend my index finger.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Victory is at hand!”[%p]
Daru twitches at my cry.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“With unimaginable brilliance and unwavering conviction, I have defeated our vast and powerful enemy and now stand triumphant on the field of Ragnarok!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I give thanks to the comrades... whose sacrifice made this victory possible!”[%p]
One press of this key, and Kurisu will die.[%p]
I firmly grip my coat at the shoulder, where it has been stitched together with jagged pink thread.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The coming world... is the world I wished for!”[%p]
I wished for Mayuri to live, and Kurisu to die.[%p]
That is the truth. And I must never forget it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is the choice of Steins Gate!”[%p]
This is the choice of Okabe Rintaro.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“El Psy Kongroo!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let the world be reborn!”[%p]
I swing down my finger.[%p]
And strike the enter key.[%p]
After a while, the spinning stops, and color gradually returns to the world.[%p]
Reading Steiner activated.[%p]
The worldline has changed.[%p]
I look around the room.[%p]
Next to me is Daru.[%p]
Behind me is Mayuri.[%p]
I reach out to her, and she takes my hand with a smile.[%p]
Everything is where it should be.[%p]
It looks like nothing has changed at all.[%p]
I gently touch my coat’s shoulder, where Kurisu fixed a torn seam.[%p]
...It’s gone.[%p]
My coat isn’t torn.[%p]
The stitches, uneven from having been sewn in the dark, have disappeared.[%p]
There’s no trace of that ridiculous pink thread.[%p]
I stand up and head to the development room.[%p]
Underneath the table, the Time Leap Machine...[%p]
No.[%p]
That’s not the Time Leap Machine.[%p]
That’s the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
The upgrades Kurisu made are gone.[%p]
Nothing has changed. This world is exactly the same.[%p]
In all respects save one.[%p]
Kurisu... was never here.[%p]
I thought that I was prepared for this.[%p]
But now that I’m face-to-face with the cruel consequence of my decision...[%p]
I feel powerless, defeated. I want to cry.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“What’s wrong, Okarin?”[%p]
Mayuri runs up and grabs my arm.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Say, Mayuri.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yeah?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Who was Lab Mem 004 again?”[%p]
I need to ask.[%p]
Even though I know what the answer will be.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“004? But Okarin, there’s only three lab mems, remember? Okarin, Mayushii, and Daru-kun.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
The tears come.[%p]
I crumple to my knees.[%p]
And cover my face with my hands.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah... right. Our lab doesn’t have a fourth member. It never did...”[%p]
Her existence was rejected by the world.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin? Something really sad happened, didn’t it?”[%p]
Mayuri rubs my back.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii is here for you, Okarin.”[%p]
I embrace Mayuri.[%p]
I stifle my voice and cry.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin... don’t cry...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Please don’t leave me, Mayuri... Please... stay by my side... forever...”[%p]
Mayuri tenderly strokes my head.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii will always be with you...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Always. Just like this...”[%p]
[margin top="190"][center]All trace of Kurisu’s existence has vanished.[%p]
[center]This proves that I have returned to my original worldline.[%e]
[margin top="152"][center]This is the world I struggled to reach.[%p]
