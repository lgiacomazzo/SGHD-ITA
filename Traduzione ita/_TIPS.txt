[228]Copenhagen interpretation
[229]Copenhagen interpretation
[230]copenhagen interpretation
[231]A well-known approach to the Schrodinger’s Cat thought experiment. In this interpretation, before the box is opened, the cat exists as a combination of two wave functions, one that is “alive” and one that is “dead.” The instant the box is opened and the cat is observed, the wave function collapses to either condition. If the cat is alive upon opening the box, the wave function collapses to become “alive cat.” Conversely, if the cat is dead, the wave function collapses to become “dead cat.”
[232]Another quantum approach to this experiment is the many-worlds interpretation. In this case, the observer who found the cat alive and the observer who found the cat dead exist in two separate universes that diverge the moment the box is opened. The Copenhagen interpretation is currently the dominant theory.

[260]Chronology protection conjecture
[261]chronology protection conjecture
[262]In quantum mechanics, a theory, proposed by Stephen Hawking, that states that time travel is impossible. Any attempt to travel through time will be prevented by quantum effects. Successful time travel requires infinite “field energy,” which is impossible to obtain. In other words, the laws of causality -- and by extension, the chronology or timeline of the universe -- are protected by quantum mechanics.

[266]event Horizon
[267]Also known as the Schwarzchild surface. In a black hole, there exists a point beyond which even light can no longer escape the black hole’s immense gravity. This boundary is called the event horizon. Because light and other electromagnetic waves are responsible for conveying information, nothing that occurs within the event horizon can be observed from the outside. The center of a black hole is black because no light can escape from it.

[279]Janet’s Law
[280]Janet’s Law
[281]janet’s law
[282]A perspective on the passage of time proposed by psychologist Janet. For some reason, as one ages, time seems to pass by more quickly. For example, one year is one seventh of a 7-year-old’s life, but only one seventieth of a 70-year-old’s life. By this reasoning, the subjective length of time is inversely proportional to age.
[283]Science
[284]Schrodinger’s cat
[285]Schrodinger’s cat
[286]schrodinger’s cat
[287]A thought experiment proposed by physicist Erwin Schrodinger. Schrodinger intended it as a paradox that would refute quantum theory, but it has since been proven to not be a paradox. It is often referenced in fiction as a example of the complexities of quantum mechanics.
[288]A cat is placed inside a box. The box also contains a vial of poisonous gas and a sample of some radioactive substance. If the radioactive substance emits an alpha particle, it sets off a sensor, releasing the poisonous gas and killing the cat. Assume the radioactive substance has a 50% chance of emitting one alpha particle per hour. After one hour, you open the box.
[289]The cat has a 50/50 chance of being alive or dead. The question is, was the cat alive or dead before you found it? According to Einstein, your observation of the cat’s condition is irrelevant. The cat was either alive or dead before you opened the box.
[290]Science
[291]Collider
[292]Collider
[293]collider
[294]A device that accelerates charged particles in order to research the reactions that result when such particles collide. The type of particle accelerated also determines the name of the equipment. In recent years, most high-energy accelerators have been synchrotrons -- ring types.
[295]Ring-type accelerators are very expensive to build, but they can perform the most effective experiments. The reason for the ring shape is that charged particles can be sent through an electromagnetic field to bend their trajectory through the Lorentz force. The world’s largest synchrotrons, other than SERN’s LHC, are located in the US, the UK, and Japan.

[373]“As velocity approaches the speed of light, length approaches zero.” “As velocity approaches the speed of light, mass approaches infinity.” The general theory of relativity adds the following axioms: “In the presence of large gravitational fields, the passage of time slows down.” “In the presence of large gravitational fields, space curves.” “In the presence of large gravitational fields, mass increases.”

[447]Deja Vu
[448]Deja Vu
[449]deja vu
[450]The feeling of having experienced something before despite not having actually experienced it. It feels like you are recalling a genuine past experience, as opposed to an imagined experience or a dream. However, you are unable to recall when and where that experience occurred, which results in an intense feeling of strangeness.
[451]The cause of deja vu has yet to be determined. One theory is that it is a physiological phenomenon caused by a temporary desynchronization of the “recollection” and “storage” functions of memory. The cause is theorized to be spasms in the brain’s parahippocampal gyrus, which is in charge of spatial reasoning and the sensation of “familiarity.”

[720]More and more children are learning about the internet through this anime. It has reached the point where some scholars claim that children are better informed than their parents with regard to internet issues. Some people are even calling this new generation “RaiNet Children.”
[721]Some politicians and organizations have strongly criticized the series for “encouraging children to become hikikomori” by idealizing boys and girls who are obsessed with computers.

As Kakeru battles terrorists in cyberspace, his techniques and programs are represented as virtual robots while his enemies’ viruses take the form of monsters.

[739]Quantum Teleportation
[740]Quantum Teleportation
[741]quantum teleportation
[742]Does not refer to actual teleportation. In 2004, Japanese researchers performed the first successful “complete quantum leap” experiment. Suppose we have twin particles (photons in this case), A and B. Because they are twins, they have the property of symmetry -- if one exhibits up-spin, the other will exhibit down-spin. This means that observing either particle allows one to know the state of the other. This is called entanglement.
[743]The state of an elementary particle (photon) cannot be confirmed until observed. For the experiment, we attach Data C, the information we want to teleport, to Photon A. We are now observing photon A-C. Based on the property of symmetry, we know that, no matter how far away it may be, Photon B will change to match, effectively becoming B-C. (Note that Photon B has not yet been observed.)
[744]Afterwards, we send Photon A-C’s information from A’s observation equipment to B’s observation equipment through standard transmission. Now, observing Photon B will change it to “Photon B-C.” This process is called quantum teleportation because Data C changes position instantly.
[745]However, since one step requires using standard data transmission, it is impossible for the information to exceed the speed of light. Finally, Photon BC’s “teleported” Data C is actually a copy of Photon AC’s Data C. The whereabouts of the original Photon C become unknown. This point differentiates quantum teleportation from actual teleportation.

[882]Year 2000 Problem
[883]Y2K
[884]y2k
[885]Popularly known as the Y2K bug. At the turn of the 21st Century, there was concern over the possibility of widespread computer failure when the year turned 2000. In order to save memory space, old operating systems almost always abbreviated years to the final two digits. Hence, when 1999 changed to 2000, the last two digits would change from 99 to 00.
[886]If its programming didn’t anticipate that change, the computer could erroneously assume that the year was 1900. It was rumored that computers in the military, financial, and government sectors might malfunction and cause worldwide catastrophe. To address this issue, countermeasures were taken in the mid 1990s to manually update every program. As a result of these countermeasures, the Year 2000 problem was averted.
