[name]Faris[line]“Papa...?”[%p]
Faris stops drinking her ice milk tea and looks at me with furrowed eyebrows.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“He went to work today, nya. What about him, nyan?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So your dad... is still alive?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Of course he is, nya. Why would you ask something like that, nya?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“You’ve been acting weird today, nyan. What’s wrong, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nothing...”[%p]
I see. Faris’s dad is still alive.[%p]
Thank goodness. Now all that remains is to learn Mayuri’s fate.[%p]
Will she die, or will she live?[%p]
The answer will determine if all of this has been worth it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is it true that you and I... are a couple?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Eh...”[%p]
Faris’s face freezes.[%p]
Her lips start to tremble.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“D-don’t tell me Kyouma was only playing with Faris, nya?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“You’re terrible, nya... How could you play with the heart of a pure 17-year-old maiden!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I see that Faris is as melodramatic as ever.[%p]
Smiling wryly, I slump down in my chair and look up at the sky.[%p]
I feel an emptiness filling my heart.[%p]
Ahh, so that’s how it is.[%p]
The worldline has changed, and the only one out of place is me.[%p]
I feel so alone.[%p]
My friends don’t know me anymore.[%p]
Mayuri isn’t even my childhood friend.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I won’t let you go anywhere.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I won’t let anyone take you away.”[%p]
That didn’t happen in this timeline.[%p]
Mayuri is no longer my hostage.[%p]
I was willing to do anything to save her.[%p]
Even sacrifice the time Suzuha spent with us.[%p]
And yet...[%p]
No, think positive. Now that Mayuri’s a stranger, there’s no reason for her to die.[%p]
Just think of it this way. I sacrificed our memories in order to save Mayuri.[%p]
...That does little to alleviate the sadness.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hahaha...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma? What’s with this chuunibyou aura, nya!? We’re in the middle of an important conversation, nyan!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, Faris... It looks like I have amnesia now...”[%p]
It’s not a lie.[%p]
I have no memories of this worldline.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“That’s the world famous mad scientist for you, nya. Did the Organyaization land a headshot and make you lose your memories, nya?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma knew about the location of the stolen nyuclear weapons, and the Organization desperately tried to take back those memories, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“...Kyouma?”[%p]
Faris frowns, then leans forward and stares straight into my eyes.[%p]
Is she trying to use her power -- Cheshire Break, was it? -- to see into my mind?[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“No way...”[%p]
Faris quickly turns pale.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Really...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“So that’s why you’ve been acting strange, nya...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“This is terrible, nya! Since when? What happened?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The worldline changed. Not like you’d understand what that means.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’d call myself a space-time castaway.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“This is no time for jokes, nya! This is a serious scene, nya! I’m worried about you, so answer me honestly, nyan!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Not one word I’ve said is a lie.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You of all people should know, right?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Well... yes, nya... but...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Please, tell me about our relationship. Tell me who I am.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“You... really don’t remember?”[%p]
Faris is moved to tears.[%p]
Then she firmly clasps my hand.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Faris and Kyouma met at a RaiNet tournament, nya. It was at a small shop in Akiba, but as our life-or-death struggle unfolded, we understood each other’s hearts, nya.”[%p]
I played RaiNet?[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Then we hit it off, and Faris and Kyouma became partners, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“We were a perfect match, and kept advancing even to the grand championships, hardly losing a single match, nya.”[%p]
Then Faris starts fidgeting.[%p]
She blushes a little and looks at me sidelong.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“And then... as we fought side by side, Faris... started to want to know more about Kyouma... I couldn’t stop thinking about you...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“That’s when Faris began... to fall in love with Kyouma, nya...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I wanted to be together as partners, not only in RaiNet, but in private, too, nyan...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“So, after we won that last semifinal, I made up my mind and confessed, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“And when Kyouma said he loved me too... we shared a sweet kiss, and officially became lovers, nya.”[%p]
A s-sweet kiss...[%p]
Does that make me... a normal?[%p]
Was I really that good with women?[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“By the way, Faris and Kyouma live together, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“WHAT!?”[%p]
Living together already, when we only just started going out!?[%p]
You really are a filthy normal, current-world-line-me...[%p]
Faris answers with a wry smile.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Actually, Kyouma’s just staying over for summer break while we prepare for the RaiNet championship, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“So, um, we haven’t done anything naughty yet, nya...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Wait, what are you making me say, nyaaa!?”[%p]
She flails her arms and legs.[%p]
Oh. If it’s at Faris’s place, with her parents and the butler there, of course nothing “naughty” would happen.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Do you remember yet, nya?”[%p]
I shake my head.[%p]
It’s fundamentally impossible for me to remember the events of this worldline.[%p]
I didn’t forget those memories. I never had them in the first place.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Faris. I have a favor to ask.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nya? What is it, nya? I’ll do anything if it helps you remember, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, it’s not about my memories... it’s about Mayuri.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Mayushii? Come to think of it, you were awfully chatty with her, nya...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Tonight, around 8 PM... Mayuri might die.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Eh...!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Can you keep an eye on her?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“She might die? But... you’ve gotta be joking this time, nya?”[%p]
I gaze straight into Faris’s eyes.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m telling the truth.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She might die, or she might not. I’d say it’s fifty-fifty.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You don’t have to do anything. Just keep an eye on her, and tell me what happens.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Can you do that?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I don’t understand, nya...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“But...”[%p]
Faris clasps my hand again.[%p]
Tightly. Very tightly.[%p]
I can feel her warmth emanating through her palms.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“But Faris loves Kyouma. I love you a lot.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“So I trust you, nya. I trust you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Thank you.”[%p]
Faris is the only one I can rely on now.[%p]
I keep staring at the clock on the wall.[%p]
I was told to wait at Faris’s place, so I’ve been sitting here for two hours.[%p]
I haven’t heard from her since she told me she was going to karaoke with Mayuri.[%p]
Several hours have passed since Mayuri’s scheduled time of death.[%p]
Faris hasn’t contacted me yet, which I guess means that nothing’s happened. I wish I could know for sure.[%p]
If Mayuri were to die now, it would mean that I have failed utterly.[%p]
I have no way to return to my original worldline.[%p]
I have no way to change the past again.[%p]
The lab doesn’t exist, and neither does the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
I can’t even send a D-Mail, to say nothing of leap through time.[%p]
[name]Faris’ Dad[line]“Okabe-kun.”[%p]
Faris’s parents make an appearance.[%p]
They smile when they see me.[%p]
Come to think of it, this is the first time I’ve met Faris’s mom. She seems like an elegant lady.[%p]
[name]Faris’ Dad[line]“Is Rumiho still working?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No. She went out with a friend from work.”[%p]
Faris’s dad is alive.[%p]
I learned that fact from Faris earlier, but it’s really good to see him in the flesh.[%p]
At the very least, I didn’t have to kill this man.[%p]
[name]Faris’ Dad[line]“I see. It’s not good for a high school student to be out this late.”[%p]
[name]Faris’ Dad[line]“You need to warn her, Okabe-kun.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Understood.”[%p]
[name]Faris’ Dad[line]“Sorry I have such a troublesome daughter. I hope she’s not too hard to deal with.”[%p]
[name]Faris’ Dad[line]“I want you to know, I have great respect for you.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Thank you very much.”[%p]
I can’t believe I’ve done anything to warrant that sort of praise...[%p]
[name]Faris’ Dad[line]“Sorry about this, but my wife and I have to fly overseas for a business trip.”[%p]
At this hour!?[%p]
[name]Faris’ Dad[line]“Kuroki will be here, so just ask him if you need anything.”[%p]
[name]Faris’ Dad[line]“Well then. We’re off.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Take care.”[%p]
Once the parents leave, I drop onto the sofa, relieved.[%p]
He’s a really nice guy.[%p]
I’m glad I was able to save his life, if nothing else.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I’m home♪”[%p]
Faris returns right after her parents leave.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“That was fun!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Faris! Why didn’t you contact me? What happened to Mayuri?”[%p]
There’s concern in my voice, though I can tell from her expression that everything is okay.[%p]
I won the bet.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nothing happened to Mayushii, nyan. We sang anime songs for about two hours, and then I took her home, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I was such a gentleman, nya. I think I might have raised some yuri flags, nyan. Nyahaha.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I see...”[%p]
Mayuri is still alive.[%p]
So is Faris’s dad.[%p]
I have lost much, but as long as they’re safe, I can accept my fate.[%p]
I don’t know what will happen to Suzuha’s dream for the future, but there’s nothing I can do about that now.[%p]
Everything is fine.[%p]
This worldline is my home now. I’m going to make a life here.[%p]
I no longer have the lab or my friends. But I do have Faris. I’m not alone.[%p]
I’m so relieved to have finally achieved my goals that my body’s fatigue catches up with me all at once.[%p]
I slide down on the sofa and close my eyes.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma? Are you going to sleep, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah, just let me... rest a bit...”[%p]
I have plenty of time to think about the future.[%p]
After all, I have nothing left to fear.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Next turn. Your move, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Gah! It’s a little early, but I guess I should use a Terminal Card and turn the tables... no, this has to be a trap...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“What you do is up to you, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wait. Wait! There’s no problem my mighty brain cells can’t handle...”[%p]
But no matter how hard I try, I simply can’t visualize Faris’s piece placement.[%p]
I’m still a newbie at this game. I barely know the rules.[%p]
The finals are tomorrow -- today, actually. There’s no way I can defeat the Viral Attackers like this.[%p]
But since I’m Faris’s partner, I have no choice but to participate.[%p]
That’s why we’ve been training all night.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Alright. After careful consideration, I use Virus Checker.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nice try, nya. But Faris has plans and backup plans to counter you, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What... you say?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Now Kyouma’s server is fully exposed, nya. I use this Terminal Card to pounce on you, nyan.”[%p]
This game is only about 10% luck. The rest depends entirely upon the RaiNetter’s strategy and ability.[%p]
And Faris has the power to read people’s minds -- or emotions, at least -- so it’s easy for her to see through my plays. Her power is truly overwhelming.[%p]
She tears apart my carefully thought out plan, defeating me easily.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Gh. Another loss... That’s 19 losses out of 19 matches. I’m a disgrace to mad scientists everywhere...”[%p]
I was able to learn the rules with these 19 matches, but I’m still nowhere near tournament-level as a player.[%p]
Was I really on the same caliber as Faris on this worldline?[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“...”[%p]
I suddenly see a frown spread upon Faris’s face.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma... you really did forget RaiNet’s art of war, nya...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“It didn’t feel like Kyouma lost his memories for real until now...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I didn’t think you’d be this poopy, nya...”[%p]
Well, excuse me for being poopy.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Did Kyouma forget everything about Faris too, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Not [color index="A0140000"]everything[color index="800000"]. I just... don’t have a single memory of us as a couple.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Hnnyaa...”[%p]
Faris grows more and more downhearted. Now she’s on the verge of tears.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“That means you don’t love me anymore, nya...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“T-then there’s only one thing to do!”[%p]
Faris suddenly stands up with both fists clenched.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I’ll make your body remember, nyan!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...gh!?”[%p]
Faris approaches with bloodshot eyes, her fingers wiggling lasciviously.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A-are you going to assault me!?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“T-that’s certainly an option, nya... but this is my first time, so I want to do it gently, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Calm down! If it’s the first time, then the how the hell will my body remember it!?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyoumaaa, nyauuuun.”[%p]
Suddenly, Faris gets on all fours.[%p]
She raises her back a little, exactly like a cat ready to pounce.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Papa and Mama went overseas, nya. Kuroki’s gone home too, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“We have this whole apartment to ourselves, nya.”[%p]
She approaches slowly.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“What will you do, nya? Even without your memories, can you really resist me, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I won’t be tempted, catgirl!”[%p]
I don’t know what I should do in a situation like this. I can’t think clearly.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]”Kyoumaa! Kyoumakyoumakyouma![%p]
Finally, Faris blasts off![%p]
If I dodge, Faris is sure to fall flat on her face. That’s how fast she’s going.[%p]
So to prevent that, I catch her in my arms.[%p]
Ahh, here’s where I lose my virginity. Farewell, virginity. I would have preferred to give it away, rather than have it taken by force... but oh well.[%p]
All I can do now is prepare myself.[%p]
Suddenly, Faris falls silent.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Sniff...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Faris...?”[%p]
When I look down, she’s pressing her face against my chest, muffling her sobs.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“You not remembering... hurts so much, nya...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“The person I knew became someone I don’t know...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I can remember things we did together from before, but you have no recollection...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I can’t bring those memories back...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“It hurts so much... I wish I’d lost my memories too, nya...”[%p]
Faris’s words hit me like a blow.[%p]
I feel exactly the same way.[%p]
The Faris I knew is gone forever.[%p]
So are Mayuri, Daru, and Kurisu.[%p]
This worldline closely resembles mine. Nothing is missing... but everything has changed.[%p]
My memories seem real, and I know that they are.[%p]
But with no one else to share them, they might as well be a dream.[%p]
I’m all alone in this world.[%p]
Alienated. Isolated.[%p]
My friends will never remember me.[%p]
The events in my memories never happened.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But this...”[%p]
I gently embrace Faris’s small head.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is my choice.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Your choice?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
The path I chose so that neither Mayuri nor Faris’s dad would die.[%p]
I won the bet, so in return, I have to live with this loneliness, this isolation.[%p]
Nothing is free. Everything has a price.[%p]
I sacrificed Suzuha’s memories to save Mayuri.[%p]
That’s what Suzuha wanted.[%p]
It’s only fair that I give up something myself.[%p]
So I’m okay with this.[%p]
Because, objectively speaking, I reached my goal.[%p]
I’m okay.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m glad I have you, Faris. I want you to know that.”[%p]
Mayuri and Daru are strangers now.[%p]
Kurisu has probably returned to America.[%p]
Without Faris, without her affection, I don’t know what I would have done.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t remember falling in love...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But I’m glad that we did.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma...”[%p]
Faris lifts her face.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re the only person who knows me here, Faris.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“As long as we’re together, everything will be fine.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I hope you’ll stay with me, even now.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I probably won’t get my memories back...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But I want to fall in love with you all over again.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma... Faris wants you... to take off her cat ears, nya.”[%p]
Cat ears...?[%p]
Oh, I see. Back to Rumiho mode.[%p]
I gently take the cat-ear headband off of Faris’ head.[%p]
Her long hair falls down and dangles onto my face.[%p]
I comb through her hair with my fingers, and Faris’s eyes smile as if soothed by my touch.[%p]
She really is like a cat.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Will you... call me Rumiho?”[%p]
This is the second time she’s asked me that.[%p]
I was too self-conscious to say it the first time. But now...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Rumiho.”[%p]
Ignoring my inner shyness, I say her name.[%p]
Our faces draw close.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Will you... kiss me?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Mm...”[%p]
With difficulty, we exchange a kiss, like hummingbirds pecking at nectar.[%p]
Then Faris slowly smiles.[%p]
Her smile, her lingering tears, her everything... is awfully cute.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“You’re my prince, you know?”[%p]
This is the second time she’s told me that.[%p]
I endure the tingling in my body.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Is it okay if I still love you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Yay.”[%p]
I can no longer return to my original worldline.[%p]
I don’t intend to, either.[%p]
Because I saved both Mayuri and Faris’s dad.[%p]
I’ll keep living on this worldline.[%p]
And Faris will be by my side.[%p]
[name]Announcer[line]“Thanks for waiting, everyone! Very soon, we will start the finals and see once and for all, who is the RaiNet AccessBattlers Grand Champion!”[%p]
I hear cheers.[%p]
The finals are about to begin.[%p]
Of course, our opponents are the Viral Attackers.[%p]
On the previous worldline, Faris’s victory turned into a desperate chase through Akiba.[%p]
But that’s another thing that never happened.[%p]
Normally, I would have refused to stand here.[%p]
Since I didn’t get my memories back, I could’ve stepped down, and the cheerful catgirl would’ve probably accepted, and then proceed to fight alone.[%p]
But still I’m standing here, even though I’m aware I’m a burden.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma, are you sure you’ll be fine, nya?”[%p]
Faris turns to me anxiously, one last time.[%p]
I answer her with a firm nod.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ve decided. This is my home now.”[%p]
The story of Hououin Kyouma, of Okabe Rintaro, begins here anew.[%p]
The first line on a blank page.[%p]
I discard my feelings for the worldline that never happened.[%p]
I lock those memories deep in my heart.[%p]
In order to live here from now on, I will become this worldline’s Okabe Rintaro.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Besides, the Viral Attackers are a troublesome opponent, win or lose.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I have to protect you from them.”[%p]
Faris’s dad won’t come in his limousine to save us this time. I’m the only one who can protect Faris now.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I’m so happy, nya.”[%p]
Faris turns to me, deeply moved, and holds out her hand.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Together.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah. Together.”[%p]
Faris’s hand.[%p]
My only connection to this worldline.[%p]
I gently take hold of it, and squeeze.[%p]
