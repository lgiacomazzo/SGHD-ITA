[162]Okabe-san~ I mailed you as soon as I could. My name is Kiryu Moeka. I'm a 20 year old freelance editor. I believe I mentioned I work part time at Arc Rewrite. Sorry for taking your picture. It wasn't on purpose. I needed some shots of Akihabara for work~ and you just happened to be in one. Actually~ to tell you the truth~ I was hoping to sneak some shots of the satellite (lmao). By the way~ the picture I took was just a test~ not the final shot. That's why I was using my phone. Even if you hadn't begged me to delete it~ I wouldn't have posted it~ so don't worry!  Anyway~ I should get to the point. I'm really sorry for asking like this~ Okabe-kun~ but it would be super great if you could ask your friend~ the super hacker~ about the IBN 5100. I don't really know anything about computers~ especially old computers. All I have to go on is that picture I showed you. (Ah~ I'll attach the image.) Be absolutely~ positively sure to reply okay? I'll be waiting! And if you could~ I'd be super happy if you gave me your super hacker friend's email address. I'll mail you again. It's okay to mail you again~ right? Of course it is! Bye♪ Moeka

[210]I haven't gotten a reply yet. Are you still asleep? You sleep too much~ Okabe-kun. You're living like an old man. Well~ I guess I'm not one to talk (lmao) Anyway~ let me know when you have something on the IBN 5100. Pretty please♪ Moeka
[211]Por favor!
[212]Shining Finger
[213]O-ka-be-ku-n! I want you to reply to me already. I've been waiting~ you know. And please tell me the super hacka's address when you can. If we don't get cracking~ someone else might get to the IBN 5100 first! Moeka

[256]Are you being honest?
[257]John Titor
[258]If everything you wrote is true~ then we have a lot to talk about. Particularly concerning the IBN 5100's hidden functionality~ which I have not mentioned to anybody yet. I am indeed surprised that you know about it. However~ I have not gone to the year 2000~ though it is possible I may go there later. There are three possible explanations:  First~ the John Titor who appeared in 2000 is my future self. In other words~ I go to 2000 later and write about the things you have told me. But that would cause an a chicken and egg paradox~ wouldn't it.  Second~ you're delusional or making things up. For the sake of serious discussion~ let's set this possibility aside.  Third. You may have seen something I wrote on a different worldline. That would mean that 10 years ago~ you existed on a different worldline than the one we're on now. However~ that raises another issue. When the worldline changes~ the entire timeline is reconstructed from past to future in order to prevent a paradox from occurring. That was proven in 2036. In other words~ it should be impossible for you to retain memories of a previous worldline. Unless you too are a time traveler~ that is. Do you have any idea what the cause could be?
[259]Re:Are you being honest?
[260]John Titor
[261]Do you know anything about this code?
[262]Where did you find that?
[263]John Titor
[264]That's written in a proprietary IBN programming language used prior to 1975. You can only decipher it with an IBN 5100.

He got one of the numbers wrong~ but otherwise it was an exact match.
[613]Very interesting
[614]John Titor
[615]That's very interesting. From the events you described~ it sounds like you did indeed change the past. I suspect that the email you sent changed divergence~ if only a little. BRAVO! The instant your email arrived in the past~ you shifted from your original worldline to an ever-so-slightly different worldline. On this worldline~ you received an email from the future containing the LOTO SIX numbers. You told your friend the numbers~ perhaps because you didn't quite trust the email~ but your friend got a number wrong when he purchased the ticket. The original email likely disappeared from your send history when the worldline changed. All of this makes sense. The one thing I don't understand is how you kept your memories of the previous worldline. Just so we're clear~ you are telling the truth~ yes?
[616]Re:Very interesting
[617]John Titor
[618]
[619]Re:Very interesting
[620]John Titor
[621]Yes~ I still have my memories from before the past was changed. That's the truth.
[622]Re:Very interesting
[623]John Titor
[624]Yes~ I still have my memories from before the past was changed. That's the truth. By the way~ this is actually the second time this has happened.
[625]Re:Very interesting
[626]John Titor
[627]Yes~ I still have my memories from before the past was changed. That's the truth. By the way~ this is actually the second time this has happened. You traveled 26 years into your past.
[628]Re:Very interesting
[629]John Titor
[630]Yes~ I still have my memories from before the past was changed. That's the truth. By the way~ this is actually the second time this has happened. You traveled 26 years into your past. Haven't you experienced something similar?
[631]Re:Very interesting
[632]John Titor
[633]Yes~ I still have my memories from before the past was changed. That's the truth. By the way~ this is actually the second time this has happened. You traveled 26 years into your past. Haven't you experienced something similar? Also~ what effect do you think my intentional manipulation of the timeline might have?
[634]Memory
[635]John Titor
[636]I've confirmed that divergence is currently 0.571015%. I cannot tell what the value was before you changed the past. This is because I~ like your friends~ have no memories of the worldline before you changed the past. In the case of physical time travel~ memories are retained even if the worldline changes. That's been proven by my own experience. But in the case of an email like the one you sent~ the ″time traveler″ changes the past without actually traveling through time~ a situation that scientists in my time never even considered. It wasn't necessary~ since the invention of the time machine in 2034 gave us a means of physical time travel. So I'm afraid that I have no idea how to explain the phenomenon you've been experiencing.

[641]John Titor
[642]How exactly do you measure divergence?
[643]Re:Memory
[644]John Titor
[645]How exactly do you measure divergence? Where do those numbers come from?
[646]The many-worlds interpretation
[647]John Titor
[648]Strictly speaking~ I was not being entirely accurate when I wrote that the Everett-Wheeler model is accepted in my time. The first functional time machine was completed in 2034. In the two years following that breakthrough~ our understanding of the universe's structure grew dramatically. In 2036~ scientists proved that the universe is comprised of ″attractor fields~″ which describe the extent of worldline convergence. This theory was first proposed in 2020.
[649]Re:Re:Memory
[650]John Titor
[651]Sorry~ I forgot to answer your question. I have a meter that measures divergence. A reading of 0% divergence corresponds to the worldline I originally came from. In other words~ it's a subjective~ not absolute measurement. This tool can only indicate the ″current″ divergence.
[652]Re:The many-worlds interpretation
[653]John Titor
[654]
[655]Re:The many-worlds interpretation
[656]John Titor
[657]Please explain these attractor fields.
[658]Re:The many-worlds interpretation
[659]John Titor
[660]Please explain these ″attractor fields.″ How do they affect worldlines?
[661]Observing convergence
[662]John Titor
[663]Put simply~ attractor fields are the focal points of worldline convergence. Their existence is responsible for phenomena previously known as ″fate″ and ″chance″. There's no real point making small changes to a worldline. Due to convergence~ small changes do not have a lasting influence. Humans who can observe convergence are exceedingly rare. I haven't met anyone with that ability myself~ so I'm unqualified to give you an accurate appraisal~ but you~ Kyouma~ might be one such individual. You might have the power to observe convergence. You might be the one who can guide us to a worldline beyond 1% divergence~ across the wall that divides attractor fields.

[670]Re:Observing convergence
[671]John Titor
[672]What is beyond the wall? What will happen when we cross it?
[673]The future
[674]John Titor
[675]If we cross the wall~ we will have freedom. If we do not~ then the dystopia I came from will be your future. In exchange for providing false peace and joy~ your masters will stamp out every last vestige of free will. As I said on @channel~ my goal is to change that future. And you may be the one who can make that possible.
[676]Future 2
[677]John Titor
[678]Kyouma~ I want you      to be the Messiah.   If the same thing happens to you again~ please contact me once more. That moment will prove that you are the Messiah.

[939]You know the coin locker in front of Daibiru? I need you to check if the big locker on the lower-right is in use. Please. This is very important.
[940]Found it
[941]Daru
[942]Checked. The big locker on the lower right is in use. What's this about anyway? Don't make me your errand boy so early in the morning~ fool! ヽ(`Д⌐)ﾉ

[945]M4~ it's true that you're not very good with people~ but I think that's just part of what makes you unique and special. Besides~ you have no trouble talking to me~ do you? Honestly~ M4~ there's nobody else who works as hard as you do. I'm very thankful for that. I'm glad you joined the Rounders. Even if nobody else values you~ I'll always look out for you. Feel free to email me whenever you like.   Oh yes~ since you're finally in Nagoya~ you should try some of the local delicacies. It's not good for your health to keep eating convenience store food. Or do you not like miso~ M4? In any case~ a girl your age needs to eat better. I recommend the firm miso stew.  Your next mission is to go to Akihabara in Tokyo~ so find an apartment by next week. I deposited a special bonus in your account~ so feel free to use it.  Talk to you soon. Your mother~ FB

[1000]Did you write it?
[1001]Assistant
[1002]Have you written that [rubyBase]report[rubyTextEnd] yet? For your information~ I wasn't joking yesterday. If you blow this off~ then you have no right to call yourself a [rubyBase]scientist[rubyTextEnd]. Maybe this is too much for a freshman like you to [rubyBase]understand[rubyTextEnd]~ but writing papers is part of being a scientist!
[1003]Re:Did you write it?
[1004]Assistant
[1005]Let lesser men worry about such things! I have inventions to build and discoveries to make!
[1006]Re:Did you write it?
[1007]Assistant
[1008]I am not a mere scientist. I am an insane mad scientist!
[1009]Re:Did you write it?
[1010]Assistant
[1011]If you're so confident in your superiority~ then show me your power!
[1012]Scientist??
[1013]Assistant
[1014]What do you mean ″[rubyBase]mad[rubyTextEnd]″ scientist? More like [rubyBase]bad scientist[rubyTextEnd]~ am I right?
[1015]Re:Scientist??
[1016]Assistant
[1017]If you don't know what ″mad″ means in this context~ I'll tell you. It's the ″insane″ definition.
[1018]Re:Scientist??
[1019]Assistant
[1020]Pfft~ that's like a pun my grandpa would come up with.
[1021]Bad Scientist
[1022]Assistant
[1023]Like you could [rubyBase]do better[rubyTextEnd]!
[1024]Mad
[1025]Assistant
[1026]So you're an ″insane insane scientist~″ huh? That's like saying ″hot water heater″ (lol) or ″an aching headache″ (lol).
[1027]Re:Bad Scientist
[1028]Assistant
[1029]Aren't Americans supposed to be funny? What have they been teaching you over there?
[1030]Please?
[1031]Assistant
[1032]While you're out~ can you buy me a fork? Because I want [rubyBase]my own fork.[rubyTextEnd] And get some [rubyBase]cup noodles[rubyTextEnd] for dinner too. I think there's a brand called ″Gen-chan Ramen.″ Get those.
[1033]Home Alone
[1034]Assistant
[1035]Is it okay to leave me alone here? I'm an [rubyBase]outsider[rubyTextEnd]~ remember? I could steal all of your precious [rubyBase]Future Gadgets[rubyTextEnd].
[1036]So bored
[1037]Assistant
[1038]Japanese TV shows are all [rubyBase]boring[rubyTextEnd]~ aren't they? But then again~ all I watch in America are news and [rubyBase]dramas[rubyTextEnd].
[1039]Re:Please?
[1040]Assistant
[1041]You already have your own spoon. Why don't you have a fork even though you have a spoon? Are you stupid?
[1042]Re:Please?
[1043]Assistant
[1044]My assistant really loves her cup noodles. I'm gonna start calling you Koike-san.
[1045]Re:Home Alone
[1046]Assistant
[1047]You are not an outsider. You... are a lab mem!
[1048]Re:Home Alone
[1049]Assistant
[1050]If you really want one~ you can have it. For a price~ that is.
[1051]Re:So bored
[1052]Assistant
[1053]I agree with you there. Media in this country is controlled by the Organization. It's the key to Operation Stupidify Japan.
[1054]Re:So bored
[1055]Assistant
[1056]Be careful. The Organization controls everything you see on TV. Watch too much~ and soon you'll be dancing to their tune.
[1057]Ehhh?
[1058]Assistant
[1059]It's a [rubyBase]disgrace[rubyTextEnd] to be thought of as your partner. People will start doubting my character. Anyway~ finish your errands and get back here.
[1060]Future Gadget
[1061]Assistant
[1062]If I had to pick~ I guess I'd take this ghost ball thing. Doesn't it kind of feel artsy? But I [rubyBase]refuse[rubyTextEnd].
[1063]Re:Ehhh?
[1064]Assistant
[1065]Then why do you keep coming to the lab? In truth~ you're so happy to be a lab mem that you can't help it! Isn't that right!?
[1066]Re:Future Gadget
[1067]Assistant
[1068]You really are an @channeler.
[1069]It's too hot
[1070]Assistant
[1071]And humid. It's been a while since my last [rubyBase]Japanese summer[rubyTextEnd]~ but I don't remember it being this humid.... [rubyBase]I'm dying[rubyTextEnd]....
[1072]Favor to ask
[1073]Assistant
[1074]I forgot to mention it~ but could you buy some cup noodles for dinner? You know that brand ″[rubyBase]Hacodate Number 1[rubyTextEnd]?″ That.
[1075]asdf
[1076]Assistant
[1077]Gyah! There's [rubyBase]a cockroach[rubyTextEnd]! GELP! HELP MEEE!
[1078]Dr P
[1079]Assistant
[1080]I'm taking a bottle from the fridge~ okay?
[1081]Staring at my hand
[1082]Assistant
[1083]Seriously~ though~ [rubyBase]why am I still here?[rubyTextEnd] I was supposed to have gone back to [rubyBase]America[rubyTextEnd] by now.
[1084]Re:It's too humid
[1085]Assistant
[1086]You'll just have to deal with it until I complete my Weather Controller.
[1087]Re:It's too humid
[1088]Assistant
[1089]That's not a typo~ is it? You're an @channeler to the core.
[1090]Re:Favor to ask
[1091]Assistant
[1092]I thought you wanted to eat ″Gen-chan Ramen.″ Make up your mind.
[1093]Re:Fujiko!
[1094]Assistant
[1095]I'll teach you the Hououin Art of Cockroach Slaying. Then you'll have nothing to fear!
[1096]Re:Staring at my hand
[1097]Assistant
[1098]It's the choice of Steins Gate. El Psy Kongroo.
[1099]Re:Staring at my hand
[1100]Assistant
[1101]You miss your mommy? Then just make an international call!
[1102]It's Hacodate Number 1!
[1103]Assistant
[1104]I never said anything about ″Gen-chan Ramen.″ Is it good?
[1105]Roach
[1106]Assistant
[1107][rubyBase]Nae-chan[rubyTextEnd] killed it for me. Thank god she was here. Japanese roaches are so fast. So scary.
[1108]Re:Roach
[1109]Assistant
[1110]Uh~ nice typo. You used the kanji for ″wither.″ Something tells me that's not the name her daddy gave her.
[1111]Being here
[1112]Assistant
[1113]I don't know about this Steins Gate thing~ but maybe chaos theory can explain how you derailed my life~ lol. At any rate~ take responsibility for getting me involved.
[1114]Plans
[1115]Assistant
[1116]Going from Tokyo to Aomori by bullet train is over 15~000 yen per person~ but the overnight bus is only 5~000 yen. Which do you prefer? I want to cover the [rubyBase]traveling expenses[rubyTextEnd]~ but I don't have that much on hand. I'm staying at a hotel~ but I'm not a celeb. Mama's pretty strict on money. Not to mention she'd kill me if she knew I was going to see my father. So maybe we should go by [rubyBase]overnight bus[rubyTextEnd] to fit our budget?
[1117]Re:Plans
[1118]Assistant
[1119]What is this nonsense? Don't forget your duty as a lab mem!
[1120]Re:Plans
[1121]Assistant
[1122]I'm fine either way.
[1123]Idiot!
[1124]Assistant
[1125]What do you mean nonsense!? Die! What the HELL~ Okabe!
[1126]Overnight bus
[1127]Assistant
[1128]Thanks~ that helps. I'll keep plugging away at this Time Leap Machine. After all~ I am a lab mem lol
[1129](⌐・ω・` )
[1130]Assistant
[1131]Sorry for getting mad (⌐・ω・` )But Okabe~ did you have to say it like that?
[1132]The key (ﾉД`)
[1133]Assistant
[1134]Um~ there's nobody at the lab. [rubyBase]I don't have a key[rubyTextEnd]~ so I can't get in. When are you coming over? I just assumed you'd be here~ like usual. It kind of feels like I'm visiting your [rubyBase]home[rubyTextEnd]. Er~ not that I want to visit your home or anything!
[1135]Re:The key (ﾉД`)
[1136]Assistant
[1137]Use the one hidden in the switchboard next to the door.
[1138]Re:The key (ﾉД`)
[1139]Assistant
[1140]Quit it. My room is a dead sea. Take one step inside~ and it's too late...
[1141](  ° д°  )
[1142]Assistant
[1143]I found the key easily enough. Don't you think your [rubyBase]security[rubyTextEnd] should be tighter? Should've thought about that before picking a [rubyBase]fight[rubyTextEnd] with SERN lol. Also~ what's this [rubyBase]frog[rubyTextEnd] that's been left with the key? Someone's bad taste? Only a maniac would put something that gross there. ...Actually~ it scared the crap outta me~ but keep that a [rubyBase]secret[rubyTextEnd]~ lol okay?
[1144]Home
[1145]Assistant
[1146]I bet your room's a mess. The lab's a mess too [rubyBase]because of you boys.[rubyTextEnd] Not that I'm any better when I'm focused on my research lol. I'll bring some deodorant spray next time. Then I'll wipe this [rubyBase]filth[rubyTextEnd] from the face of the earth! [rubyBase]Hyahha[rubyTextEnd]!
[1147]Re:(  ° д°  )
[1148]Assistant
[1149]You're right. I was careless. I should have known better.
[1150]Re:(  ° д°  )
[1151]Assistant
[1152]I know. I screwed up. It's all my fault.
[1153]Re:(  ° д°  )
[1154]Assistant
[1155]That's Gero Froggy. That thing's popularity exploded last year. I'm sure the Organization was involved.
[1156]Re:(  ° д°  )
[1157]Assistant
[1158]I don't need any of your frail girl appeal. Your strength has helped me more than you know.
[1159]Re:Home
[1160]Assistant
[1161]A mad scientist's lab should be a little messy. It's cooler that way.
[1162]Re:Home
[1163]Assistant
[1164]So men are nothing but filth to you? Very well. If war is what you want~ then war you shall have.
[1165]Re:Home
[1166]Assistant
[1167]You're not even trying to hide your @channeler power level anymore~ are you?
[1168]gero froggy
[1169]Assistant
[1170]had too much pizza LOLol
[1171]You're delusional~ I know
[1172]Assistant
[1173]Are you seriously considering [rubyBase]electronic locks and card keys[rubyTextEnd]? Who has that kind of [rubyBase]money[rubyTextEnd]? You're being ridiculous~ as usual. You need to face [rubyBase]reality[rubyTextEnd] for a change.
[1174]Re:Re:LHC
[1175]Assistant
[1176]That's true~ but I've always wanted to see the LHC firsthand. Until this happened~ I even thought about applying to SERN myself. Even though my field is completely unrelated~ lol.
[1177]Re:Weak
[1178]Assistant
[1179]About three years ago~ I went on a [rubyBase]roller coaster[rubyTextEnd] with my mom. I clung to her so hard I ended up putting her in a sleeper hold. This proves I'm not [rubyBase]weak[rubyTextEnd].
[1180]*
[1181]Assistant
[1182]Only if he's hot. And I'm afraid you boys don't fit the bill LOLol
[1183]Speaking of smells
[1184]Assistant
[1185]Is Hashida a [rubyBase]scent fetishist[rubyTextEnd]? I mean~ every now and then he tries [rubyBase]sniffing[rubyTextEnd] me. Can you say something to him?
[1186]GOGOGOGOGOGO
[1187]Assistant
[1188]I learned ″[rubyBase]I'm gonna give it to you straight[rubyTextEnd]″ from @channel. I don't know the source. All I know is that it's got [rubyBase]weird art[rubyTextEnd].
[1189]Re:You're delusional~ I know
[1190]Assistant
[1191]I never said anything about electronic locks and card keys. Where did that come from? ...Oh~ I get it. It must be an effect of time leaping.
[1192]Re:You're delusional~ I know
[1193]Assistant
[1194]Yes~ money is a problem. Sponsor our lab with your thesis publication money. Seriously. I'm desperate here.
[1195]Re:You're delusional~ I know
[1196]Assistant
[1197]Alright~ I'll tell you the truth~ but keep it secret. SERN is after us. I need your help.
[1198]Re:Don't call me weak
[1199]Assistant
[1200]Is that the kind of strength we're talking about? Anyway~ it sounds to me like you're just a scaredy cat. I bet you've never been inside a haunted house.
[1201]Re:Don't call me weak
[1202]Assistant
[1203]Who said you were weak? I don't remember anything like that. Probably because I time leaped. I might have said ″weak in the chest area.″ That I could believe.
[1204]Re:Speaking of
[1205]Assistant
[1206]I see... So that's what turns you on.
[1207]Re:Speaking about
[1208]Assistant
[1209]You've been working all night. The smell of your sweat might be exciting Daru. Use the lab's shower at once. I can't guarantee your safety otherwise!
[1210]Re:GOGOGOGOGO
[1211]Assistant
[1212]As sure as soda makes you burp!
[1213]Re:GOGOGOGOGO
[1214]Assistant
[1215]Now you've pissed me off.
[1216]Fingerprint
[1217]Assistant
[1218]My lab in the US has card keys and fingerprint scanners. It's pretty cool. I don't think you could ever afford them~ though.
[1219]Money
[1220]Assistant
[1221]Don't be silly. I didn't get paid for that. In fact~ my budget is quite tight. So tight that I have to spend all day cooped up in the lab. I should start sleeping here. You don't have a problem with that~ right? I mean~ you're the reason I'm still in Japan.
[1222]Reality
[1223]Assistant
[1224]I can't tell if this is true or just more of your usual BS. Okabe~ this is a serious situation. You're turning into the boy who cried wolf. So only tell me the truth from now on. Please.
[1225]Roller Coaster
[1226]Assistant
[1227]I'm not interested in haunted houses~ and I don't believe in ghosts one bit. What I'm really scared of are cars. Did you know bad driving is the number one cause of accidental death?
[1228]Fetish
[1229]Assistant
[1230]Not me~ you dummy! Hashida! You mixed us up on purpose! Die! So what~ you're fine with Hashida sniffing me? Doesn't it bother you that he's such a pervert? I was hoping you'd ask him to stop.
[1231]What kind of guy
[1232]Assistant
[1233]complains about a woman's scent? I make sure to shower every day! I'll prove it~ so come back here this instant and smell me! Get drunk off my sweet fragrance and die of diabetes! And you even dared to peek at me before... That was my first time to be seen naked by a man~ you know. \( [キリ]o[キリ])/
[1234]Blazing heat!
[1235]Assistant
[1236]Memetaa! ( ¬・ω・⌐)
[1237]I know you're watching!
[1238]Assistant
[1239]Mudamudamudamuda! Road roller!
[1240]Explain yourself!
[1241]Assistant
[1242]Hey! What the hell was that just now!? That was some loving hug! I'm seriously jealous.... Ah~ no~ not about getting hugged by you~ but about having someone of the opposite sex to lovingly hug! Don't misunderstand me! Anyway~ [rubyBase]what was that[rubyTextEnd] about?
[1243]Re:Explain yourself!
[1244]Assistant
[1245]Don't worry about it. It was just something I had to do.
[1246]Lies!
[1247]Assistant
[1248]Dammit~ even though all you do to me is sexual harassment! ヽ(`Д⌐)ﾉ
[1249]From an unpopular girl
[1250]Assistant
[1251]I don't really care if you get yourself a girlfriend~ but don't forget about the Time Leap Machine. This thing is serious. We need to get everyone together and decide what to do with it. I understand you're doing this for Mayuri's sake. Just remember~ there's more to this than just Urushibara-san. To be honest~ I'm still afraid of this monster I've created. I'd feel better if we could talk about it.
[1252]Contact me~ idiot!
[1253]Assistant
[1254]Is everything alright? What happened with that Kiryu lady? At least let me know if you're still alive! Don't say anything stupid like you're dead~ okay? Please~ just [rubyBase]reply[rubyTextEnd]. Even an email will do. I'm so [rubyBase]worried[rubyTextEnd] I can't even eat.
[1255]Re:Contact me~ idiot!
[1256]Assistant
[1257]I'm sorry for making you worry. I appreciate these emails~ I really do. They remind me that I'm not alone.
[1258]Re:Contact me~ idiot!
[1259]Assistant
[1260]Don't worry. I won't die. Not until I've fulfilled my promise to go to Aomori with you.
[1261]Re:Re:Contact me~ idiot!
[1262]Assistant
[1263]Don't ignore us like that again. Mayuri and Daru are waiting to hear from you too. I don't want to see Mayuri cry.
[1264]Re:Re:Contact me~ idiot!
[1265]Assistant
[1266]Maybe this isn't what you want to hear~ but I need you to listen. I don't care about Aomori anymore. I just want you to be safe~ Okabe. When you ran out without saying anything yesterday~ it felt like my heart was going to explode. So hurry back. Please.
[1267]Where are you now?
[1268]Assistant
[1269]Where are you? You haven't been to the lab in two days. Are you still in Akihabara? We're worried~ you know? You were acting strange yesterday. I want to help~ so tell me [rubyBase]where you are[rubyTextEnd]. I don't feel right not having you around. Where are you? I want to see you...
[1270]Re:Where are you now?
[1271]Assistant
[1272]Let me be alone. I need to think.
[1273]Upa⋯
[1274]Mayuri
[1275]You know~ I'm really sad about dropping my [rubyBase]Upa[rubyTextEnd]. It's worse than last year when I missed buying fatty [rubyBase]gero froggy[rubyTextEnd] ><
[1276]Re:Upa⋯
[1277]Mayuri
[1278]I feel your pain. That thing was worth a fortune. Our precious research funds... orz
[1279]Re:Upa⋯
[1280]Mayuri
[1281]That's the one from last year~ right? I thought you weren't interested.
[1282]Don't sell it ><
[1283]Mayuri
[1284]Upa is super popular~ you know? Even more popular than the hero~ [rubyBase]Kakeru-kun[rubyTextEnd]. They're so cute I wanna collect them all! It's like how you used to collect black [rubyBase]fingerless gloves[rubyTextEnd]~ remember?
[1285]Just Fatty
[1286]Mayuri
[1287]I didn't want any of the other Gero Froggies~ but I did want  [rubyBase]Fatty[rubyTextEnd]. But now that I think about it~ it wasn't really that cute. Actually~ it was kind of weird looking. I wonder why I wanted one so bad.  Hey~ I just realized Fatty kinda looks like [rubyBase]Daru[rubyTextEnd]-kun!
[1288]Re:Don't sell it ><
[1289]Mayuri
[1290]I have no idea who that is. I don't watch bad anime.
[1291]Re:Don't sell it ><
[1292]Mayuri
[1293]Indeed. But you must never speak of that to anyone else. It was necessary to seal the abomination lying dormant in this right arm of mine!
[1294]Re:Just Fatty
[1295]Mayuri
[1296]Do they even sell Gero Froggies anymore?
[1297]Re:Just Fatty
[1298]Mayuri
[1299]Just the body~ right? No comment on Daru's face.
[1300]It's interesting
[1301]Mayuri
[1302]RaiNet Kakeru is really interesting. You should try watching it sometime~ Okarin. It has lots of stuff that makes you think. It's not just for kids!
[1303]I remember
[1304]Mayuri
[1305]You used to go around shouting ″burn!″ and stuff. Why do boys want fire powers? I think flower powers or plushy powers would be cuter~ don't you?
[1306]I don't think so
[1307]Mayuri
[1308]I haven't heard anything about them since before the big earthquake in Shibuya last year. And even if I found one~ Mayushii has no money... (*⌐∀¬)
[1309]Dangerous
[1310]Mayuri
[1311]Daru-kun was taking a nap earlier~ and I think he has sleep apnea! It really surprised me when he stopped breathing. I told him he should lose weight~ but he won't listen. Okarin~ you should talk to him too.
[1312](;_;)
[1313]Mayuri
[1314]Mayushii's [rubyBase]spending money[rubyTextEnd] is getting dangerously low. You and Daru need to chip in too sometimes! You don't want to get between me and my [rubyBase]food[rubyTextEnd] ><
[1315]Re:(;_;)
[1316]Mayuri
[1317]Don't get angry. Next time~ I'll treat you to anything you want to eat. So keep buying more bananas for the sake of our experiments!
[1318]Re:(;_;)
[1319]Mayuri
[1320]You eat too much anyway! Go on a diet before it's too late!
[1321]Thank you very much♪
[1322]Mayuri
[1323]Just hearing that from Okarin makes me happy (≧▽≦)
[1324]It's August
[1325]Mayuri
[1326]Okarin~ do you eat [rubyBase]junk food[rubyTextEnd]? It's almost [rubyBase]festival[rubyTextEnd] season~ so if I find any food stalls~ I think I'll try them out. What do you think?
[1327]I just realized
[1328]Mayuri
[1329]You know~ I don't get fat no matter how much I eat. It's weird! Maybe it's because I go jogging with my dad every morning. You should come with us~ Okarin. It's [rubyBase]healthy[rubyTextEnd]! ( ¬・ω・⌐)
[1330]Re:It's August
[1331]Mayuri
[1332]Then buy some takoyaki without octopus! You could say that's the supreme dish.
[1333]Re:It's August
[1334]Mayuri
[1335]Now that you mention it~ we used to go to a lot of festivals together~ didn't we? Remember how I used to clean house at the shooting ranges? They called me the ″6PM Sniper.″ 
[1336]Re:Speaking about
[1337]Mayuri
[1338]The mad scientist's dictionary contains many words~ but ″healthy″ is not one of them!
[1339]Candy apple
[1340]Mayuri
[1341]Those candy apples you bought for me were really yummy! Mayushii still remembers. When we were little~ you always gave me me stuff to eat. It's your fault I'm addicted to junk food.
[1342]Rattsna
[1343]Mayuri
[1344]Remember when we went to the Hariti festival? That ″[rubyBase]Rattsna-san[rubyTextEnd]″ plushy you won is still on my desk at home.
[1345]Meat
[1346]Mayuri
[1347]That reminds me. Didn't you try eating [rubyBase]raw meat[rubyTextEnd] one time? I remember you were laughing like ″guhehe!″ And then you were absent from school for about a week after it made you sick. Why did you do that again?
[1348]Re:Rattsna
[1349]Mayuri
[1350]Rattsna? What's that? Japanese plz.
[1351]Re:Meat
[1352]Mayuri
[1353]To make a long story short~ that was basically a forbidden ceremony introduced to Europe in the Middle Ages. That ceremony later became the modern Carnival.
[1354]Re:Re:Rattsna
[1355]Mayuri
[1356]That stuffed rattlesnake~ remember? I'll bring him to the lab next time. I'm sure Rattsna-san will be happy to see you again♪
[1357]Wow♪
[1358]Mayuri
[1359]That sounds really amazing! Next time~ let me know so I can try too. I promise to eat all the [rubyBase]raw meat[rubyTextEnd] I can fit in my belly.
[1360]Re:How mysterious♪
[1361]Mayuri
[1362]Don't. It's not something an amateur could pull off. It's a double-edged sword.
[1363]Maid experience
[1364]Mayuri
[1365]You know~ I've been [rubyBase]working[rubyTextEnd] at MayQueen for [rubyBase]three months[rubyTextEnd] as of today. The other girls threw me a party! (*⌐∀¬) I can't believe I've been a [rubyBase]maid[rubyTextEnd] for three months. Time sure flew by. Oh~ but don't worry. Mayushii's still Okarin's hostage full-time.
[1366]Re:Maid experience
[1367]Mayuri
[1368]You need money to buy junk food or else you'll die of starvation. I understand.
[1369]Re:Maid experience
[1370]Mayuri
[1371]A party after just three months? Ridiculous. I don't see how that deserves congratulations. You girls are crazy.
[1372]Re:Maid experience
[1373]Mayuri
[1374]I still can't believe you're working at a maid cafe. I mean~ you still never cosplay outside of work.
[1375]Salary
[1376]Mayuri
[1377]It's not like I'm always hungry. Just most of the time. Besides~ I spend my salary at a 6:4 ratio of cosplay materials to snacks.
[1378]It's not half-baked
[1379]Mayuri
[1380]Three months is a big deal! I mean~ they celebrated my first and second months too.
[1381]Reason
[1382]Mayuri
[1383]You know why I don't cosplay. Mayushii doesn't want to stand out. I mean~ I'm your hostage~ right?
[1384]Speaking of lotteries
[1385]Mayuri
[1386]Mayushii won a [rubyBase]magazine[rubyTextEnd] sweepstakes once. Amazing~ huh? ( ≧∇≦) You know the hero of [rubyBase]Gunbam[rubyTextEnd]~ Setsuri? I won an autograph from his [rubyBase]voice actor[rubyTextEnd].
[1387]Re:Speaking of lotteries
[1388]Mayuri
[1389]You're still reading anime magazines? You're a true otaku.
[1390]Re:Speaking of lotteries
[1391]Mayuri
[1392]Setsuri? Is he from the latest Gunbam? I haven't seen it. The original is the best anyway.
[1393]Re:Speaking of lotteries
[1394]Mayuri
[1395]I never knew Mayuri was a voice actor otaku.
[1396]Going out? Lelele
[1397]Mayuri
[1398]I stopped by the store to buy some [rubyBase]Crunchy-kun[rubyTextEnd] since you said you wanted to eat them~ but you're not even here. That's mean! I put them in the fridge~ so eat them soon~ okay?
[1399]I saw him!
[1400]Mayuri
[1401]Wow! Remember how we were [rubyBase]talking[rubyTextEnd] about [rubyBase]Joy-san[rubyTextEnd] before? Well~ I just saw him on the street! The real thing! I got to shake his hand (≧▽≦)
[1402]Sengoku cosplay?
[1403]Mayuri
[1404]So you want to cosplay as a [rubyBase]warrior[rubyTextEnd] from the Sengoku period? Alrighty! Mayushii will work extra hard to have something for Winter ComiMa. I know you'll be popular with the girls. I'm not sure how to [rubyBase]feel[rubyTextEnd] about that (*^ ω^ *)
[1405]Re:Going out? Lelele~
[1406]Mayuri
[1407]Wait. When did I say I wanted to eat Crunchy-kun?
[1408]Re:I saw him!
[1409]Mayuri
[1410]Wait. When was that? Joy-san? Who's that?
[1411]Re:I saw him!
[1412]Mayuri
[1413]What are you talking about? Who's Joy-san? An assassin from the Organization!?
[1414]Re:Sengoku cosplay?
[1415]Mayuri
[1416]Wait. When did I say I'd cosplay? Did you email the wrong person?
[1417]Re:Sengoku Commander?
[1418]Mayuri
[1419]Mayuri... don't tell me you plan to sell me out to the enemy!?
[1420]About Luka-chan
[1421]Mayuri
[1422]Um~ Luka-chan said she'll forgive you if you cosplay [rubyBase]Kakeru-kun[rubyTextEnd] from RaiNet. Or maybe a Upa cosplay would be better lol. Just kidding. Leave Luka-chan to Mayushii.
[1423]Trap
[1424]Mayuri
[1425]Do you want to be a trap too? There's nothing to be ashamed of. I think crossplaying is wonderful! You have Mayushii's full support (*⌐∀¬)
[1426]Masochism
[1427]Mayuri
[1428]Luka-chan emanates an aura that makes you want to tease her~ and you just reacted to that. I understand. When Mayushii's with Luka-chan~ I feel a little sadistic too. But still~ you shouldn't tease her in real life. (⌐・ω・` )
[1429]Don't tell me
[1430]Mayuri
[1431]Do you like Luka-chan? But Okarin~ the last time there was a girl you liked~ didn't you say something like ″Going out with me will bring you misfortune~ so I'll just watch over you from afar?″
[1432]Re:About Luka-chan
[1433]Mayuri
[1434]I haven't seen RaiNet~ so I don't know what Kakeru-kun cosplay looks like.
[1435]Kakeru-kun
[1436]Mayuri
[1437]Check the interwebs for more details!
[1438]What made me happy today
[1439]Mayuri
[1440][rubyBase]Fubuki-chan and Kaede-chan[rubyTextEnd] praised me for the [rubyBase]cosplay[rubyTextEnd] I made them this time. I'm really happy (*⌐∀¬)
[1441]Re:What made me happy today
[1442]Mayuri
[1443]Who? You've never mentioned them before.
[1444]Re:What made me happy today
[1445]Mayuri
[1446]You really like making costumes~ huh? What made you so passionate about cosplay anyway?
[1447]Huh?
[1448]Mayuri
[1449]I told you before~ remember? We met at an event~ and now we're cosplay buddies. Kaede-chan is a university student studying the Sengoku period. She has a super-nice figure. Fubuki-chan is the same age as Mayushii~ and is kinda boyish~ but she was really sexy last year in her Seira cosplay.
[1450]The reason
[1451]Mayuri
[1452]You forgot? It all started when you asked for a costume of Kyoujiro~ the flame user from King of Histories. Remember? I thought it looked great on you~ but you only wore it once... such a waste (⌐・ω・` )
[1453]Where are you going?
[1454]Mayuri
[1455]Okarin~ where are you going? A [rubyBase]date[rubyTextEnd] with Chris-chan? I'm [rubyBase]jealous[rubyTextEnd]. (⌐・ω・` )
[1456]Re:Where are you going?
[1457]Mayuri
[1458]Our relationship is purely professional. She's my assistant. Nothing more.
[1459]Re:Where are you going?
[1460]Mayuri
[1461]Jealous? You want to go on a date with me?
[1462]A difficult conversation?
[1463]Mayuri
[1464]Oh... I'm a little relieved. Why is that? I've never felt this way before.
[1465]Date
[1466]Mayuri
[1467]I wanna go on a date. Would you rather go to Sanbo or Kitchen Jiro? (*⌐∀¬)
[1468]Today's worry
[1469]Mayuri
[1470]This morning~ I couldn't find [rubyBase]Pocketty[rubyTextEnd]. I almost started crying. The [rubyBase]sound[rubyTextEnd] of its ticking calms me down. If I lost it~ it would be a big shock. I don't know how I'd apologize to [rubyBase]Granny[rubyTextEnd]. I was so relieved to find Pocketty safe and sound♪
[1471]Re:Today's worry
[1472]Mayuri
[1473]Are you talking about your pocket watch? I thought I told you to stop with that weird naming scheme of yours.
[1474]Re:Today's worry
[1475]Mayuri
[1476]Be careful. That secret ability of yours~ Unlimited Clock Works~ is a double-edged sword.
[1477]Re:Today's worry
[1478]Mayuri
[1479]You used to take naps on your grandmother's lap~ didn't you?
[1480]Pocketty!
[1481]Mayuri
[1482]It's a pocket watch~ so ″Pocketty.″ It's cute and easy to understand~ so I think it's a good name.
[1483]Yeah~ yeah
[1484]Mayuri
[1485]Oh yeah~ you gave it a weird name! I completely forgot. (*⌐∀¬)
[1486]Lap pillow
[1487]Mayuri
[1488]Granny kept Pocketty in the pocket of her apron~ so I'd go to sleep hearing that sound. I think that's why Pocketty's sound makes me calm.
[1489]They had a fight
[1490]Mayuri
[1491]Kaede-chan had a [rubyBase]fight[rubyTextEnd] with her boyfriend. How do I get them to make up? Mayushii's never had a fight with anyone~ so I think it's [rubyBase]mysterious[rubyTextEnd]. I couldn't fight with the [rubyBase]person I like[rubyTextEnd].
[1492]Re:They had a fight
[1493]Mayuri
[1494]That's because you're a gentle girl~ Mayuri...
[1495]Re:They had a fight
[1496]Mayuri
[1497]Yes. It is mysterious. Why are people so cruel to each other?
[1498]Re:They had a fight
[1499]Mayuri
[1500]Since when do you have someone you like? I figured you'd put food before romance lol
[1501]Re:Re:They had a fight
[1502]Mayuri
[1503]Mayushii does have... someone she likes (*⌐∀¬) ehehe
[1504]I'm fine
[1505]Mayuri
[1506]Mayushii's been happy lately. Oh~ I guess there's one thing I'm a little sad about~ but if you add everything up~ I'm 120% satisfied with my life! ( ¬・ω・⌐)
[1507]As long as you're okay...
[1508]Mayuri
[1509]You've seemed down lately~ Okarin. Are you sure you're not pushing yourself too hard?
[1510]Um
[1511]Mayuri
[1512]Okarin became a mad scientist for Mayushii's sake~ right? Maybe it's irresponsible of me to say you don't have to act like a bad guy.
[1513]Are you coming back?
[1514]Mayuri
[1515]Are you [rubyBase]coming back[rubyTextEnd] to the lab today?
[1516]Re:Are you coming back?
[1517]Mayuri
[1518]I don't know~ but don't worry. You don't have to worry about anything.
[1519]Orion
[1520]Mayuri
[1521]I saw Orion last night. It was really pretty. I hope you were looking up [rubyBase]at the same time[rubyTextEnd]. Because then it would be like we were close by~ even if we were really far away. Stars are romantic if you think like that~ aren't they?
[1522]Re:Orion
[1523]Mayuri
[1524]Yeah~ I saw it too. First night in a while I've had time to look at the stars. But I don't think it was Orion. That's a winter constellation.
[1525]Haven't seen you in a while
[1526]Mayuri
[1527]Okarin's been acting strange lately~ so Mayushii didn't go to ComiMa today. Are you at the lab? Maybe I'll go there now. I haven't seen you in a couple of days~ you know? We usually see each other every day~ so it's really lonely (⌐・ω・` ) I know it's only been four days at most~ but I'm used to being with you all the time. I'm your hostage~ remember? Don't let go.
[1528]About yesterday
[1529]Lukako
[1530]Are you really okay with yesterday's [rubyBase]exorcism[rubyTextEnd]? I feel like a more traditional [rubyBase]ceremony[rubyTextEnd] would have been better. I'm worried [rubyBase]something[rubyTextEnd] might happen to you because my exorcism wasn't strong enough. It bothers me so much~ I can't sleep at night. P.S. Because of that~ I couldn't do more than three practice swings with Samidare.
[1531]Re:About yesterday
[1532]Lukako
[1533]It wasn't bad~ just a little clumsy. You're a servant of the gods. You need to project dignity and confidence. Work on it.
[1534]Re:About yesterday
[1535]Lukako
[1536]What would a traditional ceremony entail? I need details. Don't tell me it's an ancient forbidden secret.
[1537]Re:About yesterday
[1538]Lukako
[1539]Don't worry. Thanks to your exorcism~ my right arm has been quiet for a while. Still~ there's no telling what could set it off. If I'm forced to do battle again... Let's just pray that the Organization's assassins don't find me.
[1540]Religious services
[1541]Lukako
[1542]Dad won't teach me how to be a priest. He keeps saying he has ″thirty years of work″ left in him~ so he doesn't need my help. That doesn't explain why he keeps trying to teach me the [rubyBase]ceremonial miko dance[rubyTextEnd]~ though... P.S. I did 10 practice swings with Samidare.
[1543]About ceremonies
[1544]Lukako
[1545]Sorry. I don't know any ancient secrets. At least~ I don't think our shrine has anything like that. If you're interested in that sort of thing~ you should go to Izumo or Ise instead... Ah~ I did 10 practice swings with Samidare.
[1546]About that last mail
[1547]Lukako
[1548]Um~ I asked Mayuri-chan about what it is you're fighting against~ but she just laughed and didn't answer...  [rubyBase]What[rubyTextEnd] should I do? I want to help~ Kyouma-san!
[1549]Re:Religious services
[1550]Lukako
[1551]The ceremonial miko dance? But according to the legend of Ama-no-Iwato~ that means... no! Don't tell me your father intends to open the gate!? It's too soon!
[1552]Re:About that last mail
[1553]Lukako
[1554]You don't need to know. Not yet. Eventually~ if Steins Gate so chooses~ you will learn the truth whether you're ready or not.
[1555]Re:Re:Religious services
[1556]Lukako
[1557]W-what? What??
[1558]I made sweets
[1559]Lukako
[1560]I baked [rubyBase]cookies[rubyTextEnd] today. I had everyone in my [rubyBase]family[rubyTextEnd] eat some~ and got their seal of approval. Would it be okay if I baked some for your lab friends~ master? Oh~ and it would be great if you could teach me some more techniques with Samidare whenever you have [rubyBase]time[rubyTextEnd]. P.S. I managed 10 practice swings today.
[1561]Re:I made sweets
[1562]Lukako
[1563]Well done. We warmly welcome your refreshments. In fact~ you can come cook for us every day if you want. I'll even provide you with a maid uniform.
[1564]Re:I made sweets
[1565]Lukako
[1566]You sure get along with your family. How many family members do you have anyway? Daru keeps insisting that shrine maidens should come in pairs.
[1567]Re:I made sweets
[1568]Lukako
[1569]You mustn't depend on me. Remember~ all things come to an end. Every meeting heralds a parting. I can't hide from the Organization forever~ and the seal on my arm grows weaker by the day. When I'm gone~ you'll have to take care of yourself.
[1570]Please let me think
[1571]Lukako
[1572]I'd be happy to cook~ but I'm afraid it might interfere with my [rubyBase]shrine duties[rubyTextEnd]... Do you mind if I take some time to [rubyBase]think it over[rubyTextEnd]? P.S. I was so deep in thought I didn't do any practice swings with Samidare...
[1573]My family
[1574]Lukako
[1575]There's my mom~ my dad~ my older sister~ and my grandpa. [rubyBase]My sister[rubyTextEnd]'s personality is the polar opposite of mine: she's really boyish. When we were small~ she always made me help prepare dinner instead of her. Because of that~ I started to love [rubyBase]cooking[rubyTextEnd]... P.S. I did 20 practice swings with Samidare
[1576]I've depended on you too much
[1577]Lukako
[1578]I'm sorry. Whenever I talk to you~ I realize how far I still have to go. Maybe it's because I'm still a minor~ but that's no excuse. I need to learn to be [rubyBase]self-reliant[rubyTextEnd]. If I depend on you too much again~ please scold me... P.S. I did [rubyBase]20[rubyTextEnd] practice swings with Samidare. I feel I'm getting a little stronger. But I still can't do anything without you~ Okabe-san. Please teach me.
[1579]Re:Please let me think
[1580]Lukako
[1581]Your true class is Miko. You must not forget that. Devote yourself to that for now. Of course~ that includes practice swings with Samidare.
[1582]Re:Please let me think
[1583]Lukako
[1584]I was joking. Besides~ if you wore a maid outfit at the lab~ Daru would probably start hyperventilating and... well~ it wouldn't be pretty. Forget about it.
[1585]Re:About my family members
[1586]Lukako
[1587]You have a sister? I visit the shrine a lot~ but I've never met her.
[1588]Re:About my family members
[1589]Lukako
[1590]Mayuri is always praising your cooking skills. Actually~ can you teach her how to cook? Maybe then she'll eat something besides junk food.
[1591]Re:I've depended on you too much
[1592]Lukako
[1593]Everyone experiences that at your age~ so don't let it bother you. What's important is the determination~ the resolution~ born from the regret of not being able to protect those important to you....
[1594]Re:I've depended on you too much
[1595]Lukako
[1596]Fool! 20 is nothing! Do 100 swings~ then we'll talk!
[1597]About my duties
[1598]Lukako
[1599]I'm a man~ though~ so I'm not a real miko... I do my best to perform my miko duties~ but do the gods really want a miko like me? I know I need to be strong~ but I just...  P.S. I did 30 practice swings with Samidare.
[1600]Not to be a bother
[1601]Lukako
[1602]Oh... I wouldn't want Hashida-san to hyperventilate. I really want to cook for you~ Okabe-san~ but it's probably best if I don't...
[1603]About my older sister
[1604]Lukako
[1605]She's away at university~ so she's almost never home. You know how I said she's boyish? Well~ I've always had trouble saying no to her~ so she and my father used to make me do [rubyBase]things[rubyTextEnd]... I mean~ [rubyBase]you know[rubyTextEnd]. Just thinking about it makes me want to cry... P.S. I was so deep in thought I didn't do any practice swings with Samidare...
[1606]About cooking
[1607]Lukako
[1608]It's weird for a guy to like cooking~ isn't it... But it makes me happy when people I like eat my food and say it's delicious. I think that's why I don't mind cooking. Is that still okay? P.S. I was a little restless~ so I couldn't do any practice swings.
[1609]Please let me cry
[1610]Lukako
[1611]So~ Kyouma-san~ there were times you couldn't protect those important to you~ weren't there. I'm sorry~ but even though I don't know anything about it~ imagining Kyouma-san in such pain made me cry... P.S. I was crying~ so I couldn't do any practice swings...
[1612]Re:About my older sister
[1613]Lukako
[1614]I need details! Was this an ancient holy ritual that no man can observe lest he be blinded by the purity of the feminine essence!?
[1615]Re:About my older sister
[1616]Lukako
[1617]Don't tell me they defiled you!? In that case~ you may have lost your powers as a miko....
[1618]Re:Re:About my older sister
[1619]Lukako
[1620]They didn't defile me! They just made me wear girl's clothes ><
[1621]About frogs
[1622]Lukako
[1623]Um~ Kyouma-san~ are you familiar with [rubyBase]Gero Froggies[rubyTextEnd]? They were a huge fad last year. We have a tons of them at the shrine~ so if you like~ could you take a few off our hands? [rubyBase]Dad[rubyTextEnd] brought a whole box home for some [rubyBase]reason[rubyTextEnd]. Then he said they were for me... I don't know what to do with them! P.S. I was so bewildered~ I couldn't do any practice swings with Samidare.
[1624]Re:About frogs
[1625]Lukako
[1626]Those weird-looking frog things that were popular with teenage girls in Shibuya last year~ right? If I'm not mistaken~ they came out with a wide variety of them.
[1627]Re:About frogs
[1628]Lukako
[1629]You know~ the stories you tell paint a very different picture of your father than the impression I got from meeting him. Which is the true him~ I wonder.
[1630]Re:About frogs
[1631]Lukako
[1632]I suspect that last year's Gero Froggy boom was an Organization plot. Be careful~ Lukako. Those Gero Froggies may be responsible for your father's strange behavior...
[1633]More news about the frogs
[1634]Lukako
[1635]There are only two or three types in the box. I'll send you a picture. If you want any~ please tell me. I'll bring them over. P.S. I did 10 practice swings.
[1636]He's irresponsible...
[1637]Lukako
[1638]My dad usually acts normal~ but he gets strange when only family members are around. Like~ why I was raised [rubyBase]as a girl[rubyTextEnd] in the first place? Dad says that I was supposed to have another sister born before me~ but when I asked mom~ she said he was [rubyBase]making it up.[rubyTextEnd] I'm kind of [rubyBase]fed up[rubyTextEnd] with him... P.S. I did 10 practice swings.
[1639]I'll be careful
[1640]Lukako
[1641]The Gero Froggies are responsible!? But he was acting strange way before Gero Froggy existed... sorry! I said something impertinent. I'll be careful from now on... Um~ he'll be okay~ right? P.S. I didn't swing Samidare again...
[1642]Re:He's irresponsible...
[1643]Lukako
[1644]That's it! There~ without a doubt~ lies the key to that tragedy that occurred 15 to 20 years ago!
[1645]Re:He's irresponsible...
[1646]Lukako
[1647]How does she know he was lying? Your father may be embracing some darkness deep within his heart that he hides from everyone.
[1648]Re:He's irresponsible...
[1649]Lukako
[1650]If you don't like crossdressing~ then say so! Otherwise he'll just keep having his fun. If you want to change the status quo~ then burn those miko robes in the courtyard!
[1651]Question about the tragedy
[1652]Lukako
[1653]There was a tragedy? I don't know what you mean~ but if you say so~ then it must be true! Ah~ is that why you've been training me with Samidare? If so~ then I need to work even harder! I did 25 practice swings!
[1654]About darkness within his heart
[1655]Lukako
[1656]The darkness in his heart? I already know about the rock band he was in... but I'm pretty sure that's not related...
[1657]About miko clothes
[1658]Lukako
[1659]I can't burn these miko clothes. They're sacred. Besides~ I've been wearing them for almost as long as I can remember. They feel right. ...Ah! Was that dad's plan? I'm [rubyBase]strange[rubyTextEnd] too~ aren't I...
[1660]Re:About miko clothes
[1661]Lukako
[1662]It's too late. You have no choice but to give in...
[1663]About RaiNet
[1664]Lukako
[1665]Mayuri-chan's obsessed with this anime called [rubyBase]RaiNet[rubyTextEnd]~ so I rented it to see what it was about. I don't usually watch anime~ and when I do~ I prefer [rubyBase]romance[rubyTextEnd]~ but I found this anime to be pretty deep~ even though it's aimed at children. I was surprised. P.S. I was so engrossed in RaiNet~ I couldn't do any practice swings with Samidare. I'm sorry...
[1666]Re:About RaiNet
[1667]Lukako
[1668]Now you're hooked on RaiNet? Everyone around me is buying into this RaiNet craze. How can it be so popular? Don't tell me it's an Organization plot!?
[1669]Re:About RaiNet
[1670]Lukako
[1671]That's your problem right there. You can't waste your time with romance fluff. If you have that much free time~ then practice with Samidare.
[1672]That game was fun
[1673]Lukako
[1674]That pager number guessing game was fun! I'd love to do it again sometime. Afterwards~ I asked my mom about what it was like when she was young~ and she looked so nostalgic. I don't know why she sighed so deeply~ though. ( ^ ^ * ) P.S. I did 10 practice swings with Samidare.
[1675]Summer plans
[1676]Lukako
[1677]Have you gone to any festivals or [rubyBase]fireworks shows[rubyTextEnd] this summer? Maybe you have plans to go with [rubyBase]Mayuri[rubyTextEnd]-chan later? P.S. I did 22 practice swings with Samidare.
[1678]Re:About summer plans
[1679]Lukako
[1680]No~ too crowded. I'm being chased by the Organization~ remember? The last thing I need is a knife in the back.
[1681]Re:About summer plans
[1682]Lukako
[1683]Hmm... I don't know Mayuri's plans~ but I'm pretty sure she's busy preparing for a different sort of festival soon to take place in Ariake.
[1684]About festivals
[1685]Lukako
[1686]I see... It's true festivals are very crowded. I was hoping I might run into you at one~ but I guess the chances of that were pretty slim to begin with. Ah~ it's not like I go to every festival. Please don't misunderstand. P.S. I only did 5 practice swings with Samidare...
[1687]About Mayuri-chan
[1688]Lukako
[1689]Um... you and Mayuri-chan don't go places together? You're both lab members~ and I heard you were childhood friends~ so I thought... I'm sorry if I misunderstood... P.S. I did 30 practice swings with Samidare.
[1690]Greetings
[1691]skyclad2010@egweb.ne.jp
[1692]This is Amane Suzuha. First email! Thanks for [rubyBase]exchanging addresses[rubyTextEnd] with me yesterday. I finally made a friend [rubyBase]here[rubyTextEnd]. Yay! Don't worry. I won't email you too much. And I might be [rubyBase]slow to reply[rubyTextEnd] too. I'm kinda new at this email thing. It's okay to laugh at me!
[1693]Re:Greetings
[1694]skyclad2010@egweb.ne.jp
[1695]That wasn't an exchange. You took my address by force! I had no choice but to submit.

[1701]Haven't used cellphones much?
[1702]Actually
[1703]Part-Time Warrior
[1704]Actually~ it was [rubyBase]love at first sight[rubyTextEnd]. lol jk~ jk. Actually~ I think that human beings [rubyBase]need relationships[rubyTextEnd]~ you know? It's a matter of life and death.
[1705]Secret
[1706]Part-Time Warrior
[1707]That's a secret. Where do you think? If you get it right~ I'll take you anywhere. (Anywhere reachable by bicycle~ that is.) Take a guess! By the way~ no hints.
[1708]In the first place
[1709]Part-Time Warrior
[1710]I just got my first cellular phone [rubyBase]recently[rubyTextEnd]. When I arrived in Tokyo a few days ago~ I didn't even know [rubyBase]how to ride the train[rubyTextEnd]. So I just bought a [rubyBase]bike[rubyTextEnd] instead.
[1711]Re:Actually
[1712]Part-Time Warrior
[1713]I understand. Women are always attracted to evil over good.
[1714]Re:Actually

[1717]Re:In the first place

[1719]I can't believe there are still people our age who've never used a cellphone.
[1720]Re:In the first place
[1721]Part-Time Warrior
[1722]That has to be a joke. You're trolling me~ aren't you!
[1723]Re:In the first place
[1724]Part-Time Warrior
[1725]You must be pretty fit.
[1726]You're evil?
[1727]Part-Time Warrior
[1728]You're evil? The love at first sight thing was a joke~ okay? Are you by any chance a womanizer?
[1729]Words of wisdom?
[1730]Part-Time Warrior
[1731]Not really. I [rubyBase]don't like[rubyTextEnd] relying on people. I can handle myself! (lmao) I guess it's a pride thing.
[1732]Directly
[1733]Part-Time Warrior
[1734]If you really want to talk to someone~ you should do it face-to-face. Too much is lost in an email. Honestly~ I'd rather be talking to you in person right now. Strange thing to say after demanding your address~ I know (lmao)
[1735]Actually
[1736]Part-Time Warrior
[1737]The train didn't run through where I lived. I was astonished to see how many train lines Tokyo had. It's like a big web!
[1738]Simple is best
[1739]Part-Time Warrior
[1740]Simple is best~ right? The bicycle's basic design hasn't changed for over 100 years. By the way~ I'm not that strong.
[1741]Re:Words of wisdom?
[1742]Part-Time Warrior
[1743]It's inconsistent to say that relationships are important but you don't like relying on others.
[1744]Hungry
[1745]Part-Time Warrior
[1746]I'm so hungry! I had to skip breakfast again today. I don't have much money on hand. Are there any good places to find [rubyBase]insects or weeds[rubyTextEnd] around here? I can get by using my [rubyBase]survival skills[rubyTextEnd] if I have to.
[1747]Re:Hungry
[1748]Part-Time Warrior
[1749]You eat insects? Hardcore....
[1750]Re:Hungry

[1752]What kind of childhood did you have?

[1758]You don't want to know (lmao)
[1759]Akihabara's
[1760]Part-Time Warrior
[1761]Akihabara's such a strange town. Everywhere I look~ I see [rubyBase]drawings of cute girls[rubyTextEnd]. Some of them even have their breasts fully exposed~ which startled me. Coming here has been a real [rubyBase]culture shock[rubyTextEnd]. It's amazing how [rubyBase]peaceful[rubyTextEnd] Japan is now.
[1762]Re:Akihabara's
[1763]Part-Time Warrior
[1764]Unfortunately~ moe has become the symbol of Akihabara and the chaos that rules here. Get used to it.
[1765]Re:Akihabara's
[1766]Part-Time Warrior
[1767]I can imagine how that would shock someone who isn't prepared.
[1768]Re:Akihabara's
[1769]Part-Time Warrior
[1770]I agree. It's all because of the Organization's efforts to stupidify Japan.
[1771]What's going on?
[1772]Part-Time Warrior
[1773]It sounds like you're [rubyBase]having fun[rubyTextEnd] up there. Was that a girl's [rubyBase]scream[rubyTextEnd] I heard? You're not doing [rubyBase]something dirty[rubyTextEnd]~ are you? Do Tokyo people have loose sexual morals? I don't really understand that stuff.
[1774]Too much free time
[1775]Part-Time Warrior
[1776]But I'm so [rubyBase]bored[rubyTextEnd]! There's nothing to do here all day. At least the [rubyBase]pay[rubyTextEnd] is good... Ah~ don't [rubyBase]tell[rubyTextEnd] the boss that I've been polishing my bicycle at work~ okay? I'll get fired. I hope you understand. We're in this together~ right?
[1777]Now~ on TV
[1778]Part-Time Warrior
[1779]Just now~ I saw two guys fighting on TV. I think it was some kind of competition. It really got my blood pumping! Hey~ mind if I come over and put you in a [rubyBase]straight arm bar[rubyTextEnd]? It'll be fun!
[1780]Re:From above
[1781]Part-Time Warrior
[1782]What~ do you want to join the lab? Something tells me you're just looking for an excuse to skip work.
[1783]Re:From above
[1784]Part-Time Warrior
[1785]Don't worry. That wasn't a girl screaming.
[1786]Re:From above
[1787]Part-Time Warrior
[1788]It sounds like you have an overactive imagination. Or is it wishful thinking~ I wonder?
[1789]Re:Too much free time

[1791]What do you mean ″but?″ What are you talking about?
[1792]Re:Too much free time
[1793]Part-Time Warrior
[1794]What? The Braun Tube Workshop pays well? Maybe I'll apply for a part time job in September.
[1795]Re:Too much free time
[1796]Part-Time Warrior
[1797]Ha! You've made a fatal mistake! You exposed your own weakness to me! I'll be saving this trump card for the critical moment.
[1798]Re:Now~ on TV
[1799]Part-Time Warrior
[1800]Command sambo!? So you are an Organization assassin!
[1801]After
[1802]Part-Time Warrior
[1803]I might be [rubyBase]quitting[rubyTextEnd] in two days. Don't tell the boss~ okay? He'll kill me.
[1804]Re:Re:Policeman
[1805]Part-Time Warrior
[1806]Oh... By the way~ what's a yakuza? Also~ do you know where I can find a gun? Just wondering.
[1807]Re:Re:Nae
[1808]Part-Time Warrior
[1809]Nae says you're scary (lmao) She likes me~ though! It's nice~ like having a little sister. Gotta take care of her! Plus she's my excuse to skip work (lmao)

[1815]The last time I fell asleep at work~ the boss woke me up with his fist. Ow! Well~ no one to blame but myself.
[1816]Riding a bicycle
[1817]Part-Time Warrior

[1819]Re:Russia

[1821]That's from Russia~ right? All I know about Russia are those cute dolls. I've never been.

[1828]Oneself
[1829]Part-Time Warrior
[1830]It's easy to pretend to be someone you're not. Ultimately~ however~ there's no escaping the contradictions between your [rubyBase]false self[rubyTextEnd] and the real you. It's a paradox~ and paradoxes can't hold. I tried to tell myself that I didn't need anyone~ that forming bonds would only hurt~ but somehow I ended up joining your circle of friends. I still don't know if it was for the best. No~ I'm sure it was. Without you~ I would have given up on ever finding my dad. I don't know why I wrote all this. I guess what I'm trying to say is... thanks.
[1831]Re:Oneself

[1839]You're more [rubyBase]purrceptive[rubyTextEnd] than I thought~ nya. So now you understand what's at stake. The [rubyBase]Red Southern Cross[rubyTextEnd] will soon [rubyBase]hatch[rubyTextEnd]~ nya. The time has come for Faris to journey to the Sanctuary and prepare for... I can say no more~ nya...
[1840]Re:The decisive battle is close at hand nya
[1841]Faris
[1842]What are you talking about? Will you quit testing me with this mockery?
[1843]Re:The decisive battle is close at hand nya
[1844]Faris
[1845]I see. So the Holders of Original Sin -- those who~ like me~ were born of Prototype 13 -- have begun to assemble in Akiba~ guided by the star that we alone can see. The time is right.
[1846]Re:The decisive battle is close at hand nya
[1847]Faris
[1848]Impossible. You mean it's already awakening? It's 50 years earlier than I predicted. What does this mean!?
[1849]You can't fool me~ nya
[1850]Faris
[1851]You know exactly what I mean~ nya. Why do you think I approached you~ Kyouma? The Story has already come to life~ nya. I must to prepare you for what you must face. That's my role as the Guide~ nya.
[1852]So that was it after all nya
[1853]Faris
[1854]The Holders of Original Sin~ also known as the Prophets~ nya. Among them is the girl known as ″the Fallen Angel who Accepted Chaos~″ nya. I attached a picture of her face~ so rememburr it well~ nya. Oh~ and before I furrget~ looking at the picture without protection will cause Divine Eye to activate Original Sin Excitation (Mode 666: Compulsory Receptor Release) which will annihilate you at the subatomic level. So be careful~ nya!
[1855]It's already a state of emergency nya
[1856]Faris
[1857]That's why you need to locate ″the 14th man″ as soon as possible~ nya. He must be in the Hawk's Nest~ also known as Eagle Prison~ which exists somewhere in Akiba.
[1858]Original Sin level rising to 180%
[1859]Faris
[1860]Kyouma... when operating in the [rubyBase]Mundane World[rubyTextEnd]~ you're supposed to be [rubyBase]discrete~[rubyTextEnd] nya. You don't want Them to notice you. Remember~ the summoning has taken [rubyBase]2000[rubyTextEnd] years to prepare. If it fails~ everything will be ruined... although I suppose that might make things [rubyBase]interesting[rubyTextEnd]~ nyahaha.
[1861]Re:Original Sin level rising to 180%
[1862]Faris
[1863]Akiba~ part of the Mundane World? Nonsense. This town has belonged to Chaos for centuries. As it shall forevermore.
[1864]Re:Original Sin level rising to 180%
[1865]Faris
[1866]Are you suggesting that I~ the great Hououin Kyouma~ run and hide? You risk my ire~ catgirl.
[1867]Re:Original Sin level rising to 180%
[1868]Faris
[1869]Is the Church still devoted to that fool's errand? Even if they manage to resurrect their Messiah~ humanity's faith is less than 17% of what it was in his time. Mankind doesn't need decrepit old gods to save them.
[1870]Re:Original Sin level rising to 180%
[1871]Faris
[1872]You... what are you scheming?
[1873]The truth of the world
[1874]Faris
[1875]I didn't say anything about Akiba~ nya. If you want to learn the Truth of the World~ then come to me at once~ nya. It's time for the prelude to ruin~ the grand banquet to begin!
[1876]Unreasonyable!
[1877]Faris
[1878]Don't tell me you plan to face them head on? But that will turn Akiba into a sea of blood~ nyan! Restrain yourself~ Kyouma!
[1879]Song of Prophecy
[1880]Faris
[1881]But the fallen angel~ FES~ prophesied His resurrection in her song Esoteric Choker~ nyan. This song is the cat's meow♪ I found a copy of the album she put out back in her indie days (had to pay through the whiskers for it)~ and faithfully decoded each song of prophecy regarding Judgment Day~ nya.

[1885]PHANTASM is the cat's meow♪

[1887]Have you bought [rubyBase]PHANTASM[rubyTextEnd]'s debut single~ nya? It's the [rubyBase]theme song[rubyTextEnd] for ″RaiNet Kakeru~″ so it's really popular. Faris bought five copies~ nya. It's my duty as a RaiNetter! Anyway~ there's an [rubyBase]important secret[rubyTextEnd] hidden in PHANTASM's songs. The key to unlocking it is... oops~ the bell's ringing~ nya. Looks like someone's here. Better see who it is.
[1888]Re:PHANTASM is the cat's meow♪
[1889]Faris
[1890]That band's vocalist... I feel a strong resonance from her.
[1891]Re:PHANTASM is the cat's meow♪
[1892]Faris
[1893]Is this another part of Operation Stupidify Humanity? Explain.
[1894]Re:PHANTASM is the cat's meow♪
[1895]Faris
[1896]I'm aware. They are said to contain directions to the Sanctuary~ as well as prophesies regarding the end of the world. Isn't that right?
[1897]The vocalist is a beautiful girl
[1898]Faris
[1899]The vocalist~ FES~ is also known as the ″Fallen Angel who Accepted [rubyBase]Chaos[rubyTextEnd]″ and ″[rubyBase]Cocytus[rubyTextEnd] Force Raid.″ Her [rubyBase]atmosphere[rubyTextEnd] has changed a little since her indie days.
[1900]RaiNet OP 2
[1901]Faris
[1902][rubyBase]RaiNet Kakeru[rubyTextEnd]'s second opening theme~ nya. First played in ep 14~ nyan. It's super cool~ nya! Looks like it made big news last year in [rubyBase]Shibuya[rubyTextEnd]'s indie scene~ but I never thought she'd make a major debut~ nya.
[1903]Exactamundo
[1904]Faris
[1905]Her songs still contain words of [rubyBase]prophecy[rubyTextEnd]. Before [rubyBase]they[rubyTextEnd] reach it~ Faris must decipher the prophecies to find the location of the [rubyBase]Holy Lan[rubyTextEnd]~ nya!
[1906]Re:The vocalist is a beautiful girl

[1908]Become chaos. Bearing an endless pain.

Why can Faris only speak in [rubyBase]NyanNyanian[rubyTextEnd]? Where is my home~ the [rubyBase]Chinchilla Star[rubyTextEnd]? I want to know the truth. That's why I have to go~ nya!

[2009]Faris
[2010]My life has no meaning. It's all gone now. No one will look at me. Not anymore. What can I do? Even if I shout~ no one can hear. My voice can't reach the one most important to me. I walk alone through dusty gray streets~ forever pounded by lukewarm rain. Such is the fate of the defeated. Still... Faris is here. [rubyBase]Someone find me[rubyTextEnd].

[2019]I've confirmed that divergence is currently 0.523299%. I cannot tell what the value was before you changed the past. This is because I~ like your friends~ have no memories of the worldline before you changed the past. In the case of physical time travel~ memories are retained even if the worldline changes. That's been proven by my own experience. But in the case of an email like the one you sent~ the ″time traveler″ changes the past without actually traveling through time~ a situation that scientists in my time never even considered. It wasn't necessary~ since the invention of the time machine in 2034 gave us a means of physical time travel. So I'm afraid that I have no idea how to explain the phenomenon you've been experiencing.
