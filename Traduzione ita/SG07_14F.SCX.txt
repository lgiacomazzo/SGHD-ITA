Faris’s father is still at home, so we go to the UPX cafe to talk.[%p]
Faris orders a sandwich.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Do you have something in mind, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s a gamble...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But we can change the contents of the D-Mail you sent.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“We’re not going to cancel the first prank mail, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Exactly.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I win as long as I get back the IBN 5100. Your father doesn’t need to die.”[%p]
Right as I say that, the employee comes to us with the sandwich and drinks.[%p]
She looks startled.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Uh, we’re talking about a game...”[%p]
The employee forces a smile at my lame excuse, then heads back inside.[%p]
I turn back to Faris.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I think we should send a D-Mail that says something like...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“’Give the IBN 5100 to Okabe Rintaro.’”[%p]
I think ten years is about the limit of how far back we can send D-Mails.[%p]
Phone mail didn’t become widespread until then.[%p]
Lukako’s mom’s pager was a special case, but even that was still limited to the 1990’s.[%p]
So I don’t think we can do anything fancy, like tell Faris’s dad to start stockpiling IBN 5100s in 1975.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“But you know, back then, Papa’s company was down and he didn’t have much capital, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I doubt you could say anything to stop him from selling the IBN 5100 if he needed money to save me, nyan.”[%p]
Faris frowns and takes a bite of her egg sandwich.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That depends on what we send. If we make it seem like it came from the kidnappers, then your father has to find another way.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“He’s a retro PC collector, so he should have plenty of other PCs he could sell, right?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“He wouldn’t get enough money with those, nyan. Back then, the IBN 5100 was the only one people would pay through the nose for, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Then this is something only you can pull off.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll say it again. This is only a bet.”[%p]
A bet to escape the responsibilities of a god.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How will the worldline change? What will that new worldline bring? I don’t have the answers.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It may become a world where neither Mayuri nor your father can be saved, but it could also be one where both can.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s no way to be sure, but I can’t leave things the way they are. I can’t let Mayuri die. And I can’t let your dad die.”[%p]
A gamble. All or nothing.[%p]
Is Faris alright with that? Two lives hang in the balance.[%p]
I don’t want to be making decisions that affect whether people live or die.[%p]
But I can’t think of any alternative.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“If that’s your decision... then it’s okay with me, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Really?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I know that you’re trying to save Papa, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“And I’m really grateful for that, nyan.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I think I’m falling in love with you, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“D-don’t tease me like that.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“But I’m not just teasing, nyan.”[%p]
Faris pouts cutely.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Does Kyouma hate girls like me, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
She stares into my eyes, saying nothing.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“N-no wonder you’re MayQueen’s number one maid! You know how to flatter your customers...”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]”...I don’t like it when Kyouma dodges the question, nya.” [%p]
Now she makes a sad face and drops her shoulders.[%p]
Don’t tell me that was a real confession of love to me.[%p]
Sure, Faris is cute.[%p]
I don’t have as much trouble dealing with her as I used to.[%p]
I could certainly get used to the idea of being with a girl like her.[%p]
I am a man, after all. And any man would be overjoyed to win the heart of a girl like Faris.[%p]
But this is no time for romance.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Faris... let’s do this together.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’ll come out all right... trust me.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“I guess you’re never gonna answer me, nya...”[%p]
Faris looks a little sad, but after a deep breath, she smiles again.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“...I’m with you, Kyouma. Let’s send that D-Mail, nya.”[%p]
We have our plan.[%p]
Will the dice come up odd or even?[%p]
Not even God knows.[%p]
I take Faris with me to the lab, and Daru weeps tears of joy at her safety.[%p]
Mayuri jumps on her with a hug. Kurisu keeps reading, her expression aloof.[%p]
I tell the three of them I’ll explain later -- though I don’t know if I’ll get the opportunity, since we’re changing the past -- and head with Faris straight to the development room.[%p]
Faris has already written the D-Mail.[%p]
The root of the problem is her fake ransom demand, which caused her father to sell his IBN 5100.[%p]
This is a second threatening email written to prevent that.[%p]
Its time of arrival is one hour after the first D-Mail.[%p]
I set the timer and exchange glances with Faris.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s no turning back.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“It hope I still remember you, nya, after the worldline changes.”[%p]
Even that is no guarantee.[%p]
This isn’t like Suzuha’s case, where I returned the warped worldline back to normal.[%p]
We’re warping it even more. I wouldn’t be surprised if there were changes more drastic than the elimination of moe from Akiba.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Even if you forget, I’ll remember.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma, I wannya hold hands.”[%p]
I take Faris’s hand, then activate the microwave.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Go for it, Faris.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Sending... nyan.”[%p]
