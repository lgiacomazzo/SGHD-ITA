The tired Kurisu, the reenergized Daru, and the ever-energetic Mayuri repeat the same conversation I’ve seen hundreds of times.[%p]
And then they go search for the restaurant.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I turn my back to them and walk towards the ocean.[%p]
But Suzuha stands in front of me, blocking my way.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Her eyes bore into mine. [%p]
I try to pass without saying anything.[%p]
But she cuts me off.[%p]
I see the sincere concern in her eyes, but it can no longer sway my heart. Not even a little.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Hey. Wasn’t there a movie about a guy who gets trapped in some kind of time loop?”[%p]
What?[%p]
What the hell is she talking about?[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Groundhog Day, right? It was like a hundred years old when I saw it.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“The movies in my time are all boring. SERN propaganda, you know? So we watch old movies instead.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Like Groundhog Day.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Never heard of it.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It was pretty unsatisfying.”[%p]
I was trying to brush her off, but Suzuha keeps talking.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I mean, the loop ends without the hero really doing anything. Like, he becomes a good person and suddenly, happy ending.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Kinda dumb.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You’re trapped in a loop too, aren’t you? All of us are.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Say something, Okabe Rintaro.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You’ve been here before, haven’t you?”[%p]
Her gaze seems to pierce through everything.[%p]
I find myself blinking involuntarily.[%p]
Then my eyes drop to my feet.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What... what are you talking about?”[%p]
A hoarse voice leaks from the back of my throat.[%p]
It doesn’t sound like my own.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I saw Big Sight for the first time today. But this isn’t the first time I’ve seen it.”[%p]
I feel my heart skip a beat.[%p]
Maybe I’m just over-thinking it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Word games?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“We’ve come here before, haven’t we?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You’ve experienced today multiple times, haven’t you?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“How many times?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Answer me!”[%p]
Suddenly, Suzuha seizes my arm.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You have the eyes of a dead man.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I know those eyes. They’re everywhere you look in my time!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Look at me, Okabe Rintaro! Don’t kill your soul!”[%p]
Slowly, feelings rise.[%p]
From the depths of my heart.[%p]
Like an oiled machine grinding back to life.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Makise Kurisu’s soon to be completed time leap machine. You’ve been using it to repeat the past, haven’t you!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What if I have?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Why are you doing this!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Who knows. The reason no longer matters.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What are you running from?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Running? Yeah... I’m running.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Running from Mayuri’s death.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That’s why I’m going to 1975. I’ll bring you the IBN 5100, and then you can--”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No. You fail.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And then, after 25 lonely, meaningless years, you hang yourself.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What? But...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s why I’m hiding in this loop. So that neither you nor Mayuri will die.”[%p]
That’s it. That was the reason.[%p]
I entered this loop resolved to save them.[%p]
But my resolve has long since turned to dust.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“As long as I repeat these two days, nothing changes. Nobody dies.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]”I’ve accepted that duty. To keep everyone alive.” [%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“That’s only from your perspective!”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“The world continues into the future independent of you! No matter how many thousands of loops you make, Shiina Mayuri will still die.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It’s not a solution!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah...”[%p]
My lips twist into a self-deriding smile.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But I’m not looking for a solution.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Do you intend to keep looping forever?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yes. I’ve accepted that duty.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You haven’t accepted anything! Can’t you see how it’s twisted you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No matter what happens to me, this world will continue. The loop will continue. No matter what happens, the loop will not end.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“How long can you endure living frozen in time?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You can’t keep this up forever, you know?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Your body may never die. But look at yourself, Okabe Rintaro. Your soul is already hanging by a thread.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But... what else can I do?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t have it in me to sacrifice anyone...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You... Mayuri... you’re my friends. I can’t lose either of you...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
Suzuha hangs her head with a sorrowful expression.[%p]
Is the interrogation over?[%p]
I try to end the conversation by walking towards the sea again.[%p]
But she grabs my hand to stop me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You have more to say?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Do I really... hang myself?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...Do I really fail my mission?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
Suzuha bites her lip and hangs her head.[%p]
Maybe I shouldn’t have told her the truth.[%p]
But it doesn’t really matter.[%p]
If I time leap again, this conversation will never have happened.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“In that case...”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Will you come with me, Okabe Rintaro?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...What?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Will you come with me? To 1975.”[%p]
That’s the last thing I expected to hear.[%p]
Go with her... to 1975?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What will happen if I go?”[%p]
Suzuha grasps my hand tightly.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You can help me, so that I don’t fail.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“And maybe... we can find another way to change the future.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is that... possible?”[%p]
My heart beats.[%p]
My eyes open.[%p]
Color returns to the world.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“The worldline might shift in a completely unanticipated direction.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What you know as the present may change dramatically.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“The Future Gadget Lab might not exist in the future we make.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Shiina Mayuri, Hashida Itaru, and Makise Kurisu might not even be born.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Even if they are born, they might be different people with different names.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But if we go to 1975, we’ll have 35 years before we reach the 2010 Divergence.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I don’t know how we’ll change the worldline, but we’ll have plenty of time to prepare.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“If you’re okay with all that, then why not come with me?”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“To tell the truth... I want someone to come with me.”[%p]
Someone. In other words, it doesn’t have to be me.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I don’t want to go knowing I’ll fail. I don’t want my death to be meaningless.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“So come with me. Save me.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“I want to save you too. I can’t bear to see you like this.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Will you continue this loop until your soul is ground to nothing? Once that happens, time will start moving again, and the ending you’ve been postponing will occur.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“When your soul finally dies, Shiina Mayuri will die too. I will fail and hang myself. All according to schedule.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“What you’re doing is nothing but slow suicide.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“If you’re willing to go that far, then come with me instead.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Save me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I...”[%p]
The hands of my clock stopped ticking long ago.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I...”[%p]
Now, slowly, they begin to move forward.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...I’ll go.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’ll go with you. Please, take me with you.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Thank you.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...I’m sorry. I should have noticed sooner.”[%p]
Suzuha gently embraces me, as if to warm my frozen heart.[%p]
The wind blows. The clouds flow and change shape.[%p]
Sunset.[%p]
The sky is so terribly orange.[%p]
The color of dawn.[%p]
The color of dusk.[%p]
The color of the world’s end.[%p]
The color of the world’s beginning.[%p]
While Daru was repairing the time machine, I let my mind rest.[%p]
I avoided all contact, slept like a log, and tried to piece my soul back together.[%p]
On the afternoon of the 13th, I receive word that the repairs are complete. I send an email calling all members to a meeting.[%p]
Then, as everyone else gathers at the lab, I head to Radi-Kan alone.[%p]
Suzuha is waiting there, standing before the time machine with glistening eyes.[%p]
She gives me one last warning.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Remember, this time machine only goes one way. Once we leave, there’s no coming back.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Even so, will you still come with me?”[%p]
I slowly nod.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And you? Are you sure about this?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s a good chance we’ll both lose our memories during the leap.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You said it took me 24 years to remember.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“But this time, I have you. Something might change.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wishful thinking.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Does that mean you’re backing out? I’m going, no matter what.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...No. I’ve made up my mind.”[%p]
I don’t know how it will turn out.[%p]
We’re certainly at a disadvantage.[%p]
But still, I never thought I’d be so thankful to not know what’s coming next.[%p]
It’s so stimulating, it sends shivers down my spine. I feel like I’m actually here.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“Did you tell everyone?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I... bid them farewell.”[%p]
Mayuri.[%p]
Daru.[%p]
Kurisu.[%p]
I left them each a handwritten letter.[%p]
The lab is probably chaos by now.[%p]
I also mailed letters to my parents and my friends at school, telling them to not look for me. My parents will probably be sad. But this time, I’m not running away. I want to believe I’m not running away.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“You know...”[%p]
Suzuha stands next to me, looking at the time machine.[%p]
She finally smiles, though her eyes still shine with unshed tears.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“It’s kinda like we’re eloping.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s nothing to feel guilty about.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“In fact, I want to thank you, Suzuha. If you hadn’t invited me, I’d still be in the loop, living like a corpse.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So thank you, Suzuha. Let’s fight to change the future, together.”[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...Yeah.”[%p]
We clasp our hands.[%p]
Suzuha’s grip is so strong, it kind of hurts.[%p]
But that pain tells me I’m alive.[%p]
Nobody sends us off.[%p]
Nobody could.[%p]
This is a one way trip through time.[%p]
Once we go, there’s no coming back.[%p]
1975. That’s before I was even born.[%p]
We’re headed for the past...[linebreak] no...[linebreak] for a future that has yet to be written.[%p]
Not the worldline Suzuha left.[%p]
Nor the worldline she desired.[%p]
We are reaching for an entirely new future.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Our eyes meet.[%p]
Our hands clasped tightly.[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]“...Let’s go.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
The time has come for us to depart.[%p]
Our mission, to change 35 years of history. [%p]
We boldly lift our heads, ready to challenge fate.[%p]
Together.[%p]
