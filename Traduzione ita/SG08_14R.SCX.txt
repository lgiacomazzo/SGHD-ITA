I’m leaning against the wall, hugging both knees. I don’t remember how long I’ve been here.[%p]
How much time has passed since Mayuri’s death?[%p]
I didn’t go to the vigil or to the funeral.[%p]
How could I, when I’m the one who killed her?[%p]
I don’t want to see anything or anyone.[%p]
Even breathing is hard now.[%p]
And yet, I have no choice but to face this emptiness, this heartrending guilt, and accept what I’ve done.[%p]
That is my duty now.[%p]
Someone pulls the curtain open.[%p]
Light shines in from the lounge.[%p]
A girl is standing there, silhouetted against the light.[%p]
As soon as I realize who it is, I turn away and prepare to block out the noise.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe. It’s been three days. Will you at least eat something?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You knew, didn’t you?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You knew that Mayuri would die.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Why don’t you time leap?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I was sure that you would do anything to save Mayuri, even use the Time Leap Machine.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What happened to your plan to change Urushibara-san’s gender and take back the IBN 5100?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You were so set on saving Mayuri. What are you still doing here?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Wait... did you already send the D-Mail? Did you already change worldlines?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“If so, and you’re just a remnant Okabe left behind, then that means worldlines are parallel, and this line is doomed to continue without Mayuri...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...I didn’t send the D-Mail.”[%p]
My voice is hoarse, perhaps because I haven’t spoken in three days.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What do you mean?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...I couldn’t change Lukako back into a guy.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Instead... I chose to accept fate.”[%p]
No... that makes it sound like I wasn’t responsible.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I stood by... and let Mayuri die.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
I hear Kurisu gasp.[%p]
Why did I confess?[%p]
It’s not something I should confess so easily.[%p]
It’s like admitting to murder.[%p]
It should have been a secret between Lukako and me.[%p]
And yet...[%p]
Do I want to be blamed? Would that make me feel better?[%p]
It hurts to live with this bottled-up guilt. At this point, I’d welcome condemnation.[%p]
Kurisu isn’t one to mince words. I’m sure she’ll tell me exactly what a worthless human being I am.[%p]
However...[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Will you eat?”[%p]
Kurisu betrays my expectations.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I can make cup noodles, if you like. Or should I go get something?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Say something. I killed Mayuri. Why won’t you blame me?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I suppose I could, but why? It looks like you’ve already blamed yourself enough.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Maybe we just don’t have the right to change the past after all.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Besides...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No one can blame you.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You’ve been fighting alone this whole time, one man disconnected from causality.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No one else can understand your pain.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“No one else can understand the meaning of your choice.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“There’s no way I can blame you, when I haven’t time leaped even once.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...How can you be so understanding?”[%p]
I clutch my knees.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m not. When you chose to save Mayuri with the Time Leap Machine, you must have known that no one would ever understand.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So accept what you’ve done.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Do that, and you’ll never forget the meaning of your choice.”[%p]
So in other words, she’s telling me to suffer on my own.[%p]
What a cruel woman.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“However...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You should also take responsibility for the girl you [color index="A0140000"]did[color index="800000"] save.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Mayuri is dead. It’s sad -- no, sad doesn’t even begin to describe it -- but Mayuri is gone.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You couldn’t change convergence. You couldn’t defy fate.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But [color index="A0140000"]she[color index="800000"] is still alive. Thanks to you, she’s still alive, as a girl.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“And I think she’s suffering alone, just like you.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Aren’t you the only one who can understand her suffering? You’re her accomplice, remember?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Her accomplice...”[%p]
I knew you would pull no punches, Makise Kurisu.[%p]
Lukako’s image floats through my mind.[%p]
She used to be a guy.[%p]
But now she’s a girl. And she’ll live as a girl from now on.[%p]
I am the one who chose that future for Lukako.[%p]
When I imagine her frail smile, I feel like spring has come to thaw the frozen soil of my heart.[%p]
I can’t bear to lose Lukako too.[%p]
In that case... I know what I must do.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Thank you, Kurisu.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m glad I told you.”[%p]
As I enter the courtyard, I can almost feel the heat slowly drain away.[%p]
Beside the main building stands a large tree. Its branches, coated with vibrant leaves, sway in the gentle breeze.[%p]
The shrine is cooler than the streets of Akihabara proper. Maybe it’s because Kanda River is so close.[%p]
As usual, the shrine is empty.[%p]
I find myself standing before the offering box, gazing into the inner sanctum.[%p]
I wonder if Lukako’s home.[%p]
Her family should be here too. How should I call for her?[%p]
Just then, the wind suddenly lets up, and the sound of rustling trees stops for a bit.[%p]
In the silence, I hear someone sobbing.[%p]
It sounds like it’s coming from behind the main building.[%p]
I slowly head towards the sound.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Sniff...”[%p]
Lukako is there, sitting on the grass, hugging her knees as she cries. Samidare is in her hands.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Okabe... san.”[%p]
Lukako looks at me with wet eyes, but immediately afterwards, she buries her face into her knees.[%p]
Then her shoulders start shaking once more.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Yesterday... I went to Mayuri-chan’s funeral...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Everyone cried. I didn’t know Mayuri-chan was loved by so many people...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Of course, I loved Mayuri-chan too...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’m not really good with people, but she was always so nice to me...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“She was my best friend...”[%p]
I lost the words I was about to say.[%p]
All I can do is sit silently next to Lukako.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Why, Okabe-san...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Why are we still alive?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Mayuri-chan is dead...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“But I’m... still a girl...”[%p]
Now that she remembers being a guy, Lukako is beginning to have gender identity issues.[%p]
I have no idea how that feels.[%p]
Just as Kurisu said, Lukako is disconnected from causality too.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“It just feels wrong for me to keep living like this...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s not wrong.”[%p]
I try to cheer her up with those meaningless words, but Lukako shakes her head in denial.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Is there a way to save Mayuri-chan?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...No.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“That can’t be!”[%p]
Still crying, Lukako stands and pleads with me.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Let’s keep thinking! I’ll do anything to save Mayuri-chan!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I heard from Mayuri-chan before... that you made a device for traveling back in time.”[%p]
Is she talking about the Time Leap Machine?[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“If we use that...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We can’t.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“If we go back in time, I’m sure we’ll find a way...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There is no way.”[%p]
I make that firm declaration with hung head and clenched fists.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It may be cruel, but all we can do is accept Mayuri’s death and keep on living.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“You can’t give up! Why are you giving up? Aren’t you sad at all that Mayuri-chan died?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...There’s no way to save her.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“No! I don’t want Mayuri-chan to die!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako!”[%p]
I grab her shoulders and look straight into her eyes.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did you think it was easy for me to give up?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Okabe-san...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She was my precious childhood friend. I would have done anything to save her.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I tried to find a way. I tried everything I could think of! Do you know how many times I’ve gone back!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But nothing worked. The universe wants her dead. No matter how I try to avoid it, fate snatches Mayuri away.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I sacrificed other people’s memories and dreams. All to save Mayuri. I didn’t care who I hurt, as long as I could save her.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But I can’t do it anymore...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“There’s nothing I can do...”[%p]
No. There is something I can do. There are still things I can do to save Mayuri.[%p]
But I chose none of them.[%p]
Theoretically, it’s not impossible.[%p]
But it is impossible for me.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...I’m sorry.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I didn’t stop to think about your feelings.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“But it’s not impossible... is it? There’s still one more way left...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“If you turn me back into a guy...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I can’t do that.”[%p]
There’s no meaning to our choice if we do that.[%p]
I chose Lukako over Mayuri. Ultimately, that’s all there is to it.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Please, Okabe-san. I don’t want to be a girl so badly that I’d sacrifice Mayuri-chan!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Please, save Mayuri-chan!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I won’t turn you back into a guy.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Why...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Why won’t you!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That’s what I chose. I can’t keep on hurting people to feed my ego.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Besides, even if we go back to the original worldline, there’s no guarantee we’ll avoid Mayuri’s death.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I won’t sacrifice anyone’s memories... I won’t sacrifice your memories... for a small chance like that.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s over.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“But, Okabe-san...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“This is unforgivable...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I don’t deserve to live like this...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“How can I go on... knowing that me being a girl contributed to Mayuri’s death?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“That’s too heavy a burden... for me to bear...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Why...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Why didn’t you send the mail to my mom’s pager 18 years ago?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Why didn’t you choose Mayuri-chan over me?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You have nothing to be ashamed of. It was my choice.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I killed Mayuri. The guilt is mine.”[%p]
I am the one with the power of a god.[%p]
I am the one who chose Mayuri’s fate.[%p]
Therefore, I am the one who must bear the responsibility.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Besides, I want you to be happy.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Happy? How can I possibly be happy...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“When Mayuri died because of me?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It wasn’t because of you. Please, never say that again. You may be sad now, but...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I want you to keep going forward, and live enough for Mayuri, too.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“No... I don’t want that!”[%p]
Lukako clings to my chest.[%p]
She stares into my eyes without wiping away her tears.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“In that case... I want to help bear your burden, together...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Bear it together? Don’t be ridiculous.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m a man disconnected from causality. I chose to stand by and let Mayuri die.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Then I’ll disconnect myself from causality too...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I regained my memories of being a guy, so doesn’t that mean I’m already disconnected?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I also know that I’m only a girl because Mayuri paid for it with her life...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“We’re... accomplices.”[%p]
Kurisu said the same thing.[%p]
We’re accomplices, Lukako and I.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“This sadness. This guilt.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I want us both to embrace them, so we don’t forget...”[%p]
We are disconnected from causality. Nobody else can understand us.[%p]
That’s why...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I understand.”[%p]
I embrace Lukako strongly.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s bear our burden together.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s live with these memories... together.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Can I stay by your side forever?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I love you...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I know I’m betraying Mayuri-chan... but I want to be with you forever.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course.”[%p]
We both bear the same burden.[%p]
We’ll accept Mayuri’s death yet still live on, shoulder to shoulder.[%p]
Afterwards, we pass the time, sitting in silence until the sky turns the color of dusk.[%p]
Lukako rests her head on my shoulder.[%p]
I embrace her, and feel her breathing next to me.[%p]
We gaze silently at the sky.[%p]
And in our hearts, we pray for Mayuri’s happiness in the afterlife.[%p]
I’m sorry, Mayuri.[%p]
I’m sorry...[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Hey, Okabe-san...”[%p]
Lukako raises her head and breaks the silence.[%p]
I can see firm resolve in her expression.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“There’s one thing that I should have done for Mayuri-chan, but didn’t.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“And because I didn’t, I made her sad.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What was it?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...Cosplay.”[%p]
Oh... that.[%p]
These last few weeks, Mayuri was constantly asking Lukako to wear the costumes she made for her.[%p]
But Lukako was too embarrassed to try.[%p]
I remember Mayuri on the day she died.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I think Luka-chan would be an absolutely perfect Kirari-chan cosplayer!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Luka-chan’s so cute, she makes Mayushii’s heart throb, you know.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Luka-chan’s usually a very obedient girl, you know? She rarely speaks her mind.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“When you cosplay, you become another you.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That’s why I think that if Luka-chan cosplays once, she’ll definitely find a new Luka-chan, even if it’s embarrassing at first.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And when that happens, she’ll become more assertive than before, and maybe even dominate you, Okarin! Ehehe!”[%p]
Even on that day, Mayuri only talked about Lukako.[%p]
Even though I stood her up on my promise to bring Lukako to ComiMa, and made her lonely.[%p]
Mayuri wanted Lukako to cosplay from the bottom of her heart.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Can your time machine take me back to that day?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You mean [color index="A0140000"]you[color index="800000"] want to go back!?”[%p]
Lukako nods firmly.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you serious?”[%p]
Nobody’s used the Time Leap Machine except me.[%p]
It’s never failed so far, but if something does happen, it might not be reversible.[%p]
SERN’s test subjects turned into jellymen. Something like that could happen to her, or she could lose her memory like Suzuha did.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’s too dangerous. So far, I’m the only one who’s used it.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Please!”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“At the very least, I want to see Mayuri-chan off with a smile.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Because I wasn’t able to do anything for her...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But I thought you couldn’t handle all the otaku.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I am a bit scared... but this is something I have to do.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Besides, I want to truly be the same as you, Okabe-san.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“If I use that device... I’ll be completely disconnected from causality, won’t I?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“And then, I could feel what you feel...”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“So please...”[%p]
Her innocent feelings warm my heart.[%p]
Lukako truly cares for me and Mayuri.[%p]
In the end, I have to grant her wish.[%p]
When we get back to the lab, no one is there.[%p]
Just a few days ago, Mayuri, Kurisu, Daru, and I were laughing here together.[%p]
With Mayuri gone, nothing seems to remain from those days but dreams.[%p]
The lab feels truly empty.[%p]
But I hide those feelings and lead Lukako to the development room.[%p]
Luckily, the 42-inch CRT is turned on downstairs, so we can start the time leap when ready.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What time will you jump to?”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“The morning of that day.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“If I jump to the day before, I don’t think I’ll be mentally stable enough to accept it as reality.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“That’s why...”[%p]
So she’s choosing the morning of that fateful day, so she can cosplay with a smile.[%p]
But to jump to that day would take at least three consecutive leaps.[%p]
Will she be able to get all the way to the 15th?[%p]
But despite my worries, Lukako’s remains undaunted.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Once you’ve leaped safely, get in touch with me. I’m sure I’ll help you get to Mayuri.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Okay...”[%p]
I cover Lukako’s head with the Time Leap Machine’s headgear.[%p]
Her body is clearly shaking.[%p]
But that’s understandable, I guess.[%p]
Even I’m starting to get tense. My heart feels like it’s about to explode.[%p]
This is the first Time Leap Machine experiment with a subject other than me.[%p]
I can’t stop thinking about the worst case scenario.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t worry. Your brain will hurt a bit, but the pain will go away soon.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“O-okay...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You must not get distracted once you reach the other side. Calm down and try to grasp your surroundings.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It’ll be okay. I’m with you.”[%p]
I gently caress Lukako’s cheek. She responds with a small sigh of relief.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“...I’m going.”[%p]
I nod and hide the shaking of my fingertips as I set the microwave timer.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“I’ll be sure to come back!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah. I’ll be waiting.”[%p]
I smile to Lukako.[%p]
Immediately afterwards, the discharge fills the room.[%p]
I open my eyes wide in wonder as Lukako’s body begins to shine.[%p]
The building shakes violently.[%p]
The smell of ozone fills the air.[%p]
The light is blinding. I can hardly keep my eyes open.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Okabe-sa--”[%p]
Lukako’s cry is suddenly cut short--[%p]
A shock ripples through my body, like it always does right after time leaping.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What the...”[%p]
This time, I wasn’t the one who leaped.[%p]
But nevertheless, I teleported from the lab to Yanabayashi Shrine.[%p]
Did the worldline change?[%p]
No. Reading Steiner didn’t activate, so I don’t think it did.[%p]
Then why?[%p]
Was it because of Lukako’s changes to the past?[%p]
I look to the side, and there I see Lukako.[%p]
She gets up and smiles once she notices my gaze.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Want to see the pictures?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Pictures?”[%p]
What’s this about pictures?[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“It worked. I did it.”[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Don’t you remember? You suddenly started acting different just now.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Right after you leaped into the past, I found myself standing here.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Did you go to ComiMa?”[%p]
Lukako once again bursts into tears.[%p]
Then she slowly nods.[%p]
She takes out a few pictures and hands them to me.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]“Mayuri-chan... was so happy...”[%p]
I look at the first picture handed to me.[%p]
I gasp in surprise when I see what’s on it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“It looks like we really got carried away...”[%p]
I realize that I am crying.[%p]
In the picture... Mayuri is smiling.[%p]
And we’re smiling with her.[%p]
