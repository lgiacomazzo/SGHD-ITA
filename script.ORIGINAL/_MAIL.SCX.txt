Okabe-san~ I mailed you as soon as I could. My name is Kiryu Moeka. I'm a 20 year old freelance editor. I believe I mentioned I work part time at Arc Rewrite. Sorry for taking your picture. It wasn't on purpose. I needed some shots of Akihabara for work~ and you just happened to be in one. Actually~ to tell you the truth~ I was hoping to sneak some shots of the satellite (lmao). By the way~ the picture I took was just a test~ not the final shot. That's why I was using my phone. Even if you hadn't begged me to delete it~ I wouldn't have posted it~ so don't worry![linebreak][linebreak]Anyway~ I should get to the point. I'm really sorry for asking like this~ Okabe-kun~ but it would be super great if you could ask your friend~ the super hacker~ about the IBN 5100. I don't really know anything about computers~ especially old computers. All I have to go on is that picture I showed you. (Ah~ I'll attach the image.)[linebreak]Be absolutely~ positively sure to reply okay? I'll be waiting! And if you could~ I'd be super happy if you gave me your super hacker friend's email address. I'll mail you again. It's okay to mail you again~ right? Of course it is! Bye♪ Moeka

Are you being honest?
John Titor
If everything you wrote is true~ then we have a lot to talk about. Particularly concerning the IBN 5100's hidden functionality~ which I have not mentioned to anybody yet. I am indeed surprised that you know about it. However~ I have not gone to the year 2000~ though it is possible I may go there later. There are three possible explanations:[linebreak][linebreak]First~ the John Titor who appeared in 2000 is my future self. In other words~ I go to 2000 later and write about the things you have told me. But that would cause an a chicken and egg paradox~ wouldn't it.[linebreak][linebreak]Second~ you're delusional or making things up. For the sake of serious discussion~ let's set this possibility aside.[linebreak][linebreak]Third. You may have seen something I wrote on a different worldline. That would mean that 10 years ago~ you existed on a different worldline than the one we're on now. However~ that raises another issue. When the worldline changes~ the entire timeline is reconstructed from past to future in order to prevent a paradox from occurring. That was proven in 2036. In other words~ it should be impossible for you to retain memories of a previous worldline. Unless you too are a time traveler~ that is. Do you have any idea what the cause could be?
Re:Are you being honest?
John Titor
Do you know anything about this code?
Where did you find that?
John Titor
That's written in a proprietary IBN programming language used prior to 1975. You can only decipher it with an IBN 5100.

We sent an email today. It was set to arrive last Tuesday~ 170 hours ago. It contained the winning numbers for the third-place prize of that night's LOTO SIX drawing. The moment we sent the email~ my associates~ who had helped plan the experiment and watched me send it~ instantly forgot that any of that had happened. When I checked~ I found that the email had vanished from my phone's send history. I know for a fact that it arrived in the past~ as my friend bought a LOTO SIX ticket based on information I had apparently given him. He got one of the numbers wrong~ but otherwise it was an exact match.
Very interesting
John Titor
That's very interesting. From the events you described~ it sounds like you did indeed change the past. I suspect that the email you sent changed divergence~ if only a little. BRAVO! The instant your email arrived in the past~ you shifted from your original worldline to an ever-so-slightly different worldline. On this worldline~ you received an email from the future containing the LOTO SIX numbers. You told your friend the numbers~ perhaps because you didn't quite trust the email~ but your friend got a number wrong when he purchased the ticket. The original email likely disappeared from your send history when the worldline changed. All of this makes sense. The one thing I don't understand is how you kept your memories of the previous worldline. Just so we're clear~ you are telling the truth~ yes?
Re:Very interesting
John Titor

Re:Very interesting
John Titor
Yes~ I still have my memories from before the past was changed. That's the truth.
Re:Very interesting
John Titor
Yes~ I still have my memories from before the past was changed. That's the truth. By the way~ this is actually the second time this has happened.
Re:Very interesting
John Titor
Yes~ I still have my memories from before the past was changed. That's the truth. By the way~ this is actually the second time this has happened. You traveled 26 years into your past.
Re:Very interesting
John Titor
Yes~ I still have my memories from before the past was changed. That's the truth. By the way~ this is actually the second time this has happened. You traveled 26 years into your past. Haven't you experienced something similar?
Re:Very interesting
John Titor
Yes~ I still have my memories from before the past was changed. That's the truth. By the way~ this is actually the second time this has happened. You traveled 26 years into your past. Haven't you experienced something similar? Also~ what effect do you think my intentional manipulation of the timeline might have?
Memory
John Titor
I've confirmed that divergence is currently 0.571015%. I cannot tell what the value was before you changed the past. This is because I~ like your friends~ have no memories of the worldline before you changed the past. In the case of physical time travel~ memories are retained even if the worldline changes. That's been proven by my own experience. But in the case of an email like the one you sent~ the ″time traveler″ changes the past without actually traveling through time~ a situation that scientists in my time never even considered. It wasn't necessary~ since the invention of the time machine in 2034 gave us a means of physical time travel. So I'm afraid that I have no idea how to explain the phenomenon you've been experiencing.
Re:Memory

How exactly do you measure divergence?
Re:Memory
John Titor
How exactly do you measure divergence? Where do those numbers come from?
The many-worlds interpretation
John Titor
Strictly speaking~ I was not being entirely accurate when I wrote that the Everett-Wheeler model is accepted in my time. The first functional time machine was completed in 2034. In the two years following that breakthrough~ our understanding of the universe's structure grew dramatically. In 2036~ scientists proved that the universe is comprised of ″attractor fields~″ which describe the extent of worldline convergence. This theory was first proposed in 2020.
Re:Re:Memory
John Titor
Sorry~ I forgot to answer your question. I have a meter that measures divergence. A reading of 0% divergence corresponds to the worldline I originally came from. In other words~ it's a subjective~ not absolute measurement. This tool can only indicate the ″current″ divergence.
Re:The many-worlds interpretation
John Titor

Re:The many-worlds interpretation
John Titor
Please explain these attractor fields.
Re:The many-worlds interpretation
John Titor
Please explain these ″attractor fields.″ How do they affect worldlines?
Observing convergence
John Titor
Put simply~ attractor fields are the focal points of worldline convergence. Their existence is responsible for phenomena previously known as ″fate″ and ″chance″. There's no real point making small changes to a worldline. Due to convergence~ small changes do not have a lasting influence. Humans who can observe convergence are exceedingly rare. I haven't met anyone with that ability myself~ so I'm unqualified to give you an accurate appraisal~ but you~ Kyouma~ might be one such individual. You might have the power to observe convergence. You might be the one who can guide us to a worldline beyond 1% divergence~ across the wall that divides attractor fields.

Re:Observing convergence

The future
John Titor
If we cross the wall~ we will have freedom. If we do not~ then the dystopia I came from will be your future. In exchange for providing false peace and joy~ your masters will stamp out every last vestige of free will. As I said on @channel~ my goal is to change that future. And you may be the one who can make that possible.

My lab in the US has card keys and fingerprint scanners. It's pretty cool. I don't think you could ever afford them~ though.
Money
Assistant
Don't be silly. I didn't get paid for that. In fact~ my budget is quite tight. So tight that I have to spend all day cooped up in the lab. I should start sleeping here. You don't have a problem with that~ right? I mean~ you're the reason I'm still in Japan.
Reality
Assistant
I can't tell if this is true or just more of your usual BS. Okabe~ this is a serious situation. You're turning into the boy who cried wolf. So only tell me the truth from now on. Please.
Roller Coaster
Assistant
I'm not interested in haunted houses~ and I don't believe in ghosts one bit. What I'm really scared of are cars. Did you know bad driving is the number one cause of accidental death?
Fetish
Assistant
Not me~ you dummy! Hashida! You mixed us up on purpose! Die! So what~ you're fine with Hashida sniffing me? Doesn't it bother you that he's such a pervert? I was hoping you'd ask him to stop.
What kind of guy
Assistant
complains about a woman's scent? I make sure to shower every day! I'll prove it~ so come back here this instant and smell me! Get drunk off my sweet fragrance and die of diabetes! And you even dared to peek at me before... That was my first time to be seen naked by a man~ you know. \( 鴎o鴎)/
Blazing heat!
Assistant
Memetaa! ( ¬・ω・⌐)
I know you're watching!
Assistant
Mudamudamudamuda! Road roller!
Explain yourself!
Assistant
Hey! What the hell was that just now!? That was some loving hug! I'm seriously jealous.... Ah~ no~ not about getting hugged by you~ but about having someone of the opposite sex to lovingly hug! Don't misunderstand me! Anyway~ [ruby-base]what was that[ruby-text-end] about?
Re:Explain yourself!
Assistant
Don't worry about it. It was just something I had to do.
Lies!
Assistant
Dammit~ even though all you do to me is sexual harassment! ヽ(`Д⌐)ﾉ
From an unpopular girl
Assistant
I don't really care if you get yourself a girlfriend~ but don't forget about the Time Leap Machine. This thing is serious. We need to get everyone together and decide what to do with it. I understand you're doing this for Mayuri's sake. Just remember~ there's more to this than just Urushibara-san. To be honest~ I'm still afraid of this monster I've created. I'd feel better if we could talk about it.
Contact me~ idiot!
Assistant
Is everything alright? What happened with that Kiryu lady? At least let me know if you're still alive! Don't say anything stupid like you're dead~ okay? Please~ just [ruby-base]reply[ruby-text-end]. Even an email will do. I'm so [ruby-base]worried[ruby-text-end] I can't even eat.
Re:Contact me~ idiot!
Assistant
I'm sorry for making you worry. I appreciate these emails~ I really do. They remind me that I'm not alone.
Re:Contact me~ idiot!
Assistant
Don't worry. I won't die. Not until I've fulfilled my promise to go to Aomori with you.
Re:Re:Contact me~ idiot!
Assistant
Don't ignore us like that again. Mayuri and Daru are waiting to hear from you too. I don't want to see Mayuri cry.
Re:Re:Contact me~ idiot!
Assistant
Maybe this isn't what you want to hear~ but I need you to listen. I don't care about Aomori anymore. I just want you to be safe~ Okabe. When you ran out without saying anything yesterday~ it felt like my heart was going to explode. So hurry back. Please.
Where are you now?
Assistant
Where are you? You haven't been to the lab in two days. Are you still in Akihabara? We're worried~ you know? You were acting strange yesterday. I want to help~ so tell me [ruby-base]where you are[ruby-text-end]. I don't feel right not having you around. Where are you? I want to see you...
Re:Where are you now?
Assistant
Let me be alone. I need to think.
Upa⋯
Mayuri
You know~ I'm really sad about dropping my [ruby-base]Upa[ruby-text-end]. It's worse than last year when I missed buying fatty [ruby-base]gero froggy[ruby-text-end] ><
Re:Upa⋯
Mayuri
I feel your pain. That thing was worth a fortune. Our precious research funds... orz
Re:Upa⋯
Mayuri
That's the one from last year~ right? I thought you weren't interested.
Don't sell it ><
Mayuri
Upa is super popular~ you know? Even more popular than the hero~ [ruby-base]Kakeru-kun[ruby-text-end]. They're so cute I wanna collect them all! It's like how you used to collect black [ruby-base]fingerless gloves[ruby-text-end]~ remember?
Just Fatty
Mayuri
I didn't want any of the other Gero Froggies~ but I did want  [ruby-base]Fatty[ruby-text-end]. But now that I think about it~ it wasn't really that cute. Actually~ it was kind of weird looking. I wonder why I wanted one so bad.  Hey~ I just realized Fatty kinda looks like [ruby-base]Daru[ruby-text-end]-kun!
Re:Don't sell it ><
Mayuri
I have no idea who that is. I don't watch bad anime.
Re:Don't sell it ><
Mayuri
Indeed. But you must never speak of that to anyone else. It was necessary to seal the abomination lying dormant in this right arm of mine!
Re:Just Fatty
Mayuri
Do they even sell Gero Froggies anymore?
Re:Just Fatty
Mayuri
Just the body~ right? No comment on Daru's face.
It's interesting
Mayuri
RaiNet Kakeru is really interesting. You should try watching it sometime~ Okarin. It has lots of stuff that makes you think. It's not just for kids!
I remember
Mayuri
You used to go around shouting ″burn!″ and stuff. Why do boys want fire powers? I think flower powers or plushy powers would be cuter~ don't you?
I don't think so
Mayuri
I haven't heard anything about them since before the big earthquake in Shibuya last year. And even if I found one~ Mayushii has no money... (*⌐∀¬)
Dangerous
Mayuri
Daru-kun was taking a nap earlier~ and I think he has sleep apnea! It really surprised me when he stopped breathing. I told him he should lose weight~ but he won't listen. Okarin~ you should talk to him too.
(;_;)
Mayuri
Mayushii's [ruby-base]spending money[ruby-text-end] is getting dangerously low. You and Daru need to chip in too sometimes! You don't want to get between me and my [ruby-base]food[ruby-text-end] ><
Re:(;_;)
Mayuri
Don't get angry. Next time~ I'll treat you to anything you want to eat. So keep buying more bananas for the sake of our experiments!
Re:(;_;)
Mayuri
You eat too much anyway! Go on a diet before it's too late!
Thank you very much♪
Mayuri
Just hearing that from Okarin makes me happy (≧▽≦)
It's August
Mayuri
Okarin~ do you eat [ruby-base]junk food[ruby-text-end]? It's almost [ruby-base]festival[ruby-text-end] season~ so if I find any food stalls~ I think I'll try them out. What do you think?
I just realized
Mayuri
You know~ I don't get fat no matter how much I eat. It's weird! Maybe it's because I go jogging with my dad every morning. You should come with us~ Okarin. It's [ruby-base]healthy[ruby-text-end]![linebreak]( ¬・ω・⌐)
Re:It's August
Mayuri
Then buy some takoyaki without octopus! You could say that's the supreme dish.
Re:It's August
Mayuri
Now that you mention it~ we used to go to a lot of festivals together~ didn't we? Remember how I used to clean house at the shooting ranges? They called me the ″6PM Sniper.″ 
Re:Speaking about
Mayuri
The mad scientist's dictionary contains many words~ but ″healthy″ is not one of them!
Candy apple
Mayuri
Those candy apples you bought for me were really yummy! Mayushii still remembers. When we were little~ you always gave me me stuff to eat. It's your fault I'm addicted to junk food.
Rattsna
Mayuri
Remember when we went to the Hariti festival? That ″[ruby-base]Rattsna-san[ruby-text-end]″ plushy you won is still on my desk at home.
Meat
Mayuri
That reminds me. Didn't you try eating [ruby-base]raw meat[ruby-text-end] one time? I remember you were laughing like ″guhehe!″ And then you were absent from school for about a week after it made you sick. Why did you do that again?
Re:Rattsna
Mayuri
Rattsna? What's that? Japanese plz.
Re:Meat
Mayuri
To make a long story short~ that was basically a forbidden ceremony introduced to Europe in the Middle Ages. That ceremony later became the modern Carnival.
Re:Re:Rattsna
Mayuri
That stuffed rattlesnake~ remember? I'll bring him to the lab next time. I'm sure Rattsna-san will be happy to see you again♪
Wow♪
Mayuri
That sounds really amazing! Next time~ let me know so I can try too. I promise to eat all the [ruby-base]raw meat[ruby-text-end] I can fit in my belly.
Re:How mysterious♪
Mayuri
Don't. It's not something an amateur could pull off. It's a double-edged sword.
Maid experience
Mayuri
You know~ I've been [ruby-base]working[ruby-text-end] at MayQueen for [ruby-base]three months[ruby-text-end] as of today. The other girls threw me a party! (*⌐∀¬) I can't believe I've been a [ruby-base]maid[ruby-text-end] for three months. Time sure flew by. Oh~ but don't worry. Mayushii's still Okarin's hostage full-time.
Re:Maid experience
Mayuri
You need money to buy junk food or else you'll die of starvation. I understand.
Re:Maid experience
Mayuri
A party after just three months? Ridiculous. I don't see how that deserves congratulations. You girls are crazy.
Re:Maid experience
Mayuri
I still can't believe you're working at a maid cafe. I mean~ you still never cosplay outside of work.
Salary
Mayuri
It's not like I'm always hungry. Just most of the time. Besides~ I spend my salary at a 6:4 ratio of cosplay materials to snacks.
It's not half-baked
Mayuri
Three months is a big deal! I mean~ they celebrated my first and second months too.
Reason
Mayuri
You know why I don't cosplay. Mayushii doesn't want to stand out. I mean~ I'm your hostage~ right?
Speaking of lotteries
Mayuri
Mayushii won a [ruby-base]magazine[ruby-text-end] sweepstakes once. Amazing~ huh? ( ≧∇≦) You know the hero of [ruby-base]Gunbam[ruby-text-end]~ Setsuri? I won an autograph from his [ruby-base]voice actor[ruby-text-end].
Re:Speaking of lotteries
Mayuri
You're still reading anime magazines? You're a true otaku.
Re:Speaking of lotteries
Mayuri
Setsuri? Is he from the latest Gunbam? I haven't seen it. The original is the best anyway.
Re:Speaking of lotteries
Mayuri
I never knew Mayuri was a voice actor otaku.
Going out? Lelele
Mayuri
I stopped by the store to buy some [ruby-base]Crunchy-kun[ruby-text-end] since you said you wanted to eat them~ but you're not even here. That's mean! I put them in the fridge~ so eat them soon~ okay?
I saw him!
Mayuri
Wow! Remember how we were [ruby-base]talking[ruby-text-end] about [ruby-base]Joy-san[ruby-text-end] before? Well~ I just saw him on the street! The real thing! I got to shake his hand (≧▽≦)
Sengoku cosplay?
Mayuri
So you want to cosplay as a [ruby-base]warrior[ruby-text-end] from the Sengoku period? Alrighty! Mayushii will work extra hard to have something for Winter ComiMa. I know you'll be popular with the girls. I'm not sure how to [ruby-base]feel[ruby-text-end] about that (*^ ω^ *)
Re:Going out? Lelele~
Mayuri
Wait. When did I say I wanted to eat Crunchy-kun?
Re:I saw him!
Mayuri
Wait. When was that? Joy-san? Who's that?
Re:I saw him!
Mayuri
What are you talking about? Who's Joy-san? An assassin from the Organization!?
Re:Sengoku cosplay?
Mayuri
Wait. When did I say I'd cosplay? Did you email the wrong person?
Re:Sengoku Commander?
Mayuri
Mayuri... don't tell me you plan to sell me out to the enemy!?
About Luka-chan
Mayuri
Um~ Luka-chan said she'll forgive you if you cosplay [ruby-base]Kakeru-kun[ruby-text-end] from RaiNet. Or maybe a Upa cosplay would be better lol. Just kidding. Leave Luka-chan to Mayushii.
Trap
Mayuri
Do you want to be a trap too? There's nothing to be ashamed of. I think crossplaying is wonderful! You have Mayushii's full support (*⌐∀¬)
Masochism
Mayuri
Luka-chan emanates an aura that makes you want to tease her~ and you just reacted to that. I understand. When Mayushii's with Luka-chan~ I feel a little sadistic too. But still~ you shouldn't tease her in real life. (⌐・ω・` )
Don't tell me
Mayuri
Do you like Luka-chan? But Okarin~ the last time there was a girl you liked~ didn't you say something like ″Going out with me will bring you misfortune~ so I'll just watch over you from afar?″
Re:About Luka-chan
Mayuri
I haven't seen RaiNet~ so I don't know what Kakeru-kun cosplay looks like.
Kakeru-kun
Mayuri
Check the interwebs for more details!
What made me happy today
Mayuri
[ruby-base]Fubuki-chan and Kaede-chan[ruby-text-end] praised me for the [ruby-base]cosplay[ruby-text-end] I made them this time. I'm really happy (*⌐∀¬)
Re:What made me happy today
Mayuri
Who? You've never mentioned them before.
Re:What made me happy today
Mayuri
You really like making costumes~ huh? What made you so passionate about cosplay anyway?
Huh?
Mayuri
I told you before~ remember? We met at an event~ and now we're cosplay buddies. Kaede-chan is a university student studying the Sengoku period. She has a super-nice figure. Fubuki-chan is the same age as Mayushii~ and is kinda boyish~ but she was really sexy last year in her Seira cosplay.
The reason
Mayuri
You forgot? It all started when you asked for a costume of Kyoujiro~ the flame user from King of Histories. Remember? I thought it looked great on you~ but you only wore it once... such a waste (⌐・ω・` )
Where are you going?
Mayuri
Okarin~ where are you going? A [ruby-base]date[ruby-text-end] with Chris-chan? I'm [ruby-base]jealous[ruby-text-end]. (⌐・ω・` )
Re:Where are you going?
Mayuri
Our relationship is purely professional. She's my assistant. Nothing more.
Re:Where are you going?
Mayuri
Jealous? You want to go on a date with me?
A difficult conversation?
Mayuri
Oh... I'm a little relieved. Why is that? I've never felt this way before.
Date
Mayuri
I wanna go on a date. Would you rather go to Sanbo or Kitchen Jiro? (*⌐∀¬)
Today's worry
Mayuri
This morning~ I couldn't find [ruby-base]Pocketty[ruby-text-end]. I almost started crying. The [ruby-base]sound[ruby-text-end] of its ticking calms me down. If I lost it~ it would be a big shock. I don't know how I'd apologize to [ruby-base]Granny[ruby-text-end]. I was so relieved to find Pocketty safe and sound♪
Re:Today's worry
Mayuri
Are you talking about your pocket watch? I thought I told you to stop with that weird naming scheme of yours.
Re:Today's worry
Mayuri
Be careful. That secret ability of yours~ Unlimited Clock Works~ is a double-edged sword.
Re:Today's worry
Mayuri
You used to take naps on your grandmother's lap~ didn't you?
Pocketty!
Mayuri
It's a pocket watch~ so ″Pocketty.″ It's cute and easy to understand~ so I think it's a good name.
Yeah~ yeah
Mayuri
Oh yeah~ you gave it a weird name! I completely forgot. (*⌐∀¬)
Lap pillow
Mayuri
Granny kept Pocketty in the pocket of her apron~ so I'd go to sleep hearing that sound. I think that's why Pocketty's sound makes me calm.
They had a fight
Mayuri
Kaede-chan had a [ruby-base]fight[ruby-text-end] with her boyfriend. How do I get them to make up? Mayushii's never had a fight with anyone~ so I think it's [ruby-base]mysterious[ruby-text-end]. I couldn't fight with the [ruby-base]person I like[ruby-text-end].
Re:They had a fight
Mayuri
That's because you're a gentle girl~ Mayuri...
Re:They had a fight
Mayuri
Yes. It is mysterious. Why are people so cruel to each other?
Re:They had a fight
Mayuri
Since when do you have someone you like? I figured you'd put food before romance lol
Re:Re:They had a fight
Mayuri
Mayushii does have... someone she likes (*⌐∀¬) ehehe
I'm fine
Mayuri
Mayushii's been happy lately. Oh~ I guess there's one thing I'm a little sad about~ but if you add everything up~ I'm 120% satisfied with my life! ( ¬・ω・⌐)
As long as you're okay...
Mayuri
You've seemed down lately~ Okarin. Are you sure you're not pushing yourself too hard?
Um
Mayuri
Okarin became a mad scientist for Mayushii's sake~ right? Maybe it's irresponsible of me to say you don't have to act like a bad guy.
Are you coming back?
Mayuri
Are you [ruby-base]coming back[ruby-text-end] to the lab today?
Re:Are you coming back?
Mayuri
I don't know~ but don't worry. You don't have to worry about anything.
Orion
Mayuri
I saw Orion last night. It was really pretty. I hope you were looking up [ruby-base]at the same time[ruby-text-end]. Because then it would be like we were close by~ even if we were really far away. Stars are romantic if you think like that~ aren't they?
Re:Orion
Mayuri
Yeah~ I saw it too. First night in a while I've had time to look at the stars. But I don't think it was Orion. That's a winter constellation.
Haven't seen you in a while
Mayuri
Okarin's been acting strange lately~ so Mayushii didn't go to ComiMa today. Are you at the lab? Maybe I'll go there now. I haven't seen you in a couple of days~ you know? We usually see each other every day~ so it's really lonely (⌐・ω・` ) I know it's only been four days at most~ but I'm used to being with you all the time. I'm your hostage~ remember? Don't let go.
About yesterday
Lukako
Are you really okay with yesterday's [ruby-base]exorcism[ruby-text-end]? I feel like a more traditional [ruby-base]ceremony[ruby-text-end] would have been better. I'm worried [ruby-base]something[ruby-text-end] might happen to you because my exorcism wasn't strong enough. It bothers me so much~ I can't sleep at night. P.S. Because of that~ I couldn't do more than three practice swings with Samidare.
Re:About yesterday
Lukako
It wasn't bad~ just a little clumsy. You're a servant of the gods. You need to project dignity and confidence. Work on it.
Re:About yesterday
Lukako
What would a traditional ceremony entail? I need details. Don't tell me it's an ancient forbidden secret.
Re:About yesterday
Lukako
Don't worry. Thanks to your exorcism~ my right arm has been quiet for a while. Still~ there's no telling what could set it off. If I'm forced to do battle again... Let's just pray that the Organization's assassins don't find me.
Religious services
Lukako
Dad won't teach me how to be a priest. He keeps saying he has ″thirty years of work″ left in him~ so he doesn't need my help. That doesn't explain why he keeps trying to teach me the [ruby-base]ceremonial miko dance[ruby-text-end]~ though... P.S. I did 10 practice swings with Samidare.
About ceremonies
Lukako
Sorry. I don't know any ancient secrets. At least~ I don't think our shrine has anything like that. If you're interested in that sort of thing~ you should go to Izumo or Ise instead... Ah~ I did 10 practice swings with Samidare.
About that last mail
Lukako
Um~ I asked Mayuri-chan about what it is you're fighting against~ but she just laughed and didn't answer...  [ruby-base]What[ruby-text-end] should I do? I want to help~ Kyouma-san!
Re:Religious services
Lukako
The ceremonial miko dance? But according to the legend of Ama-no-Iwato~ that means... no! Don't tell me your father intends to open the gate!? It's too soon!
Re:About that last mail
Lukako
You don't need to know. Not yet. Eventually~ if Steins Gate so chooses~ you will learn the truth whether you're ready or not.
Re:Re:Religious services
Lukako
W-what? What??
I made sweets
Lukako
I baked [ruby-base]cookies[ruby-text-end] today. I had everyone in my [ruby-base]family[ruby-text-end] eat some~ and got their seal of approval. Would it be okay if I baked some for your lab friends~ master? Oh~ and it would be great if you could teach me some more techniques with Samidare whenever you have [ruby-base]time[ruby-text-end]. P.S. I managed 10 practice swings today.
Re:I made sweets
Lukako
Well done. We warmly welcome your refreshments. In fact~ you can come cook for us every day if you want. I'll even provide you with a maid uniform.
Re:I made sweets
Lukako
You sure get along with your family. How many family members do you have anyway? Daru keeps insisting that shrine maidens should come in pairs.
Re:I made sweets
Lukako
You mustn't depend on me. Remember~ all things come to an end. Every meeting heralds a parting. I can't hide from the Organization forever~ and the seal on my arm grows weaker by the day. When I'm gone~ you'll have to take care of yourself.
Please let me think
Lukako
I'd be happy to cook~ but I'm afraid it might interfere with my [ruby-base]shrine duties[ruby-text-end]... Do you mind if I take some time to [ruby-base]think it over[ruby-text-end]? P.S. I was so deep in thought I didn't do any practice swings with Samidare...
My family
Lukako
There's my mom~ my dad~ my older sister~ and my grandpa. [ruby-base]My sister[ruby-text-end]'s personality is the polar opposite of mine: she's really boyish. When we were small~ she always made me help prepare dinner instead of her. Because of that~ I started to love [ruby-base]cooking[ruby-text-end]... P.S. I did 20 practice swings with Samidare
I've depended on you too much
Lukako
I'm sorry. Whenever I talk to you~ I realize how far I still have to go. Maybe it's because I'm still a minor~ but that's no excuse. I need to learn to be [ruby-base]self-reliant[ruby-text-end]. If I depend on you too much again~ please scold me... P.S. I did [ruby-base]20[ruby-text-end] practice swings with Samidare. I feel I'm getting a little stronger. But I still can't do anything without you~ Okabe-san. Please teach me.
Re:Please let me think
Lukako
Your true class is Miko. You must not forget that. Devote yourself to that for now. Of course~ that includes practice swings with Samidare.
Re:Please let me think
Lukako
I was joking. Besides~ if you wore a maid outfit at the lab~ Daru would probably start hyperventilating and... well~ it wouldn't be pretty. Forget about it.
Re:About my family members
Lukako
You have a sister? I visit the shrine a lot~ but I've never met her.
Re:About my family members
Lukako
Mayuri is always praising your cooking skills. Actually~ can you teach her how to cook? Maybe then she'll eat something besides junk food.
Re:I've depended on you too much
Lukako
Everyone experiences that at your age~ so don't let it bother you. What's important is the determination~ the resolution~ born from the regret of not being able to protect those important to you....
Re:I've depended on you too much
Lukako
Fool! 20 is nothing! Do 100 swings~ then we'll talk!
About my duties
Lukako
I'm a man~ though~ so I'm not a real miko... I do my best to perform my miko duties~ but do the gods really want a miko like me? I know I need to be strong~ but I just...  P.S. I did 30 practice swings with Samidare.
Not to be a bother
Lukako
Oh... I wouldn't want Hashida-san to hyperventilate. I really want to cook for you~ Okabe-san~ but it's probably best if I don't...
About my older sister
Lukako
She's away at university~ so she's almost never home. You know how I said she's boyish? Well~ I've always had trouble saying no to her~ so she and my father used to make me do [ruby-base]things[ruby-text-end]... I mean~ [ruby-base]you know[ruby-text-end]. Just thinking about it makes me want to cry... P.S. I was so deep in thought I didn't do any practice swings with Samidare...
About cooking
Lukako
It's weird for a guy to like cooking~ isn't it... But it makes me happy when people I like eat my food and say it's delicious. I think that's why I don't mind cooking. Is that still okay? P.S. I was a little restless~ so I couldn't do any practice swings.
Please let me cry
Lukako
So~ Kyouma-san~ there were times you couldn't protect those important to you~ weren't there. I'm sorry~ but even though I don't know anything about it~ imagining Kyouma-san in such pain made me cry... P.S. I was crying~ so I couldn't do any practice swings...
Re:About my older sister
Lukako
I need details! Was this an ancient holy ritual that no man can observe lest he be blinded by the purity of the feminine essence!?
Re:About my older sister
Lukako
Don't tell me they defiled you!? In that case~ you may have lost your powers as a miko....
Re:Re:About my older sister
Lukako
They didn't defile me! They just made me wear girl's clothes ><
About frogs
Lukako
Um~ Kyouma-san~ are you familiar with [ruby-base]Gero Froggies[ruby-text-end]? They were a huge fad last year. We have a tons of them at the shrine~ so if you like~ could you take a few off our hands? [ruby-base]Dad[ruby-text-end] brought a whole box home for some [ruby-base]reason[ruby-text-end]. Then he said they were for me... I don't know what to do with them! P.S. I was so bewildered~ I couldn't do any practice swings with Samidare.
Re:About frogs
Lukako
Those weird-looking frog things that were popular with teenage girls in Shibuya last year~ right? If I'm not mistaken~ they came out with a wide variety of them.
Re:About frogs
Lukako
You know~ the stories you tell paint a very different picture of your father than the impression I got from meeting him. Which is the true him~ I wonder.
Re:About frogs
Lukako
I suspect that last year's Gero Froggy boom was an Organization plot. Be careful~ Lukako. Those Gero Froggies may be responsible for your father's strange behavior...
More news about the frogs
Lukako
There are only two or three types in the box. I'll send you a picture. If you want any~ please tell me. I'll bring them over. P.S. I did 10 practice swings.
He's irresponsible...
Lukako
My dad usually acts normal~ but he gets strange when only family members are around. Like~ why I was raised [ruby-base]as a girl[ruby-text-end] in the first place? Dad says that I was supposed to have another sister born before me~ but when I asked mom~ she said he was [ruby-base]making it up.[ruby-text-end] I'm kind of [ruby-base]fed up[ruby-text-end] with him... P.S. I did 10 practice swings.
I'll be careful
Lukako
The Gero Froggies are responsible!? But he was acting strange way before Gero Froggy existed... sorry! I said something impertinent. I'll be careful from now on... Um~ he'll be okay~ right? P.S. I didn't swing Samidare again...
Re:He's irresponsible...
Lukako
That's it! There~ without a doubt~ lies the key to that tragedy that occurred 15 to 20 years ago!
Re:He's irresponsible...
Lukako
How does she know he was lying? Your father may be embracing some darkness deep within his heart that he hides from everyone.
Re:He's irresponsible...
Lukako
If you don't like crossdressing~ then say so! Otherwise he'll just keep having his fun. If you want to change the status quo~ then burn those miko robes in the courtyard!
Question about the tragedy
Lukako
There was a tragedy? I don't know what you mean~ but if you say so~ then it must be true! Ah~ is that why you've been training me with Samidare? If so~ then I need to work even harder! I did 25 practice swings!
About darkness within his heart
Lukako
The darkness in his heart? I already know about the rock band he was in... but I'm pretty sure that's not related...
About miko clothes
Lukako
I can't burn these miko clothes. They're sacred. Besides~ I've been wearing them for almost as long as I can remember. They feel right. ...Ah! Was that dad's plan? I'm [ruby-base]strange[ruby-text-end] too~ aren't I...
Re:About miko clothes
Lukako
It's too late. You have no choice but to give in...
About RaiNet
Lukako
Mayuri-chan's obsessed with this anime called [ruby-base]RaiNet[ruby-text-end]~ so I rented it to see what it was about. I don't usually watch anime~ and when I do~ I prefer [ruby-base]romance[ruby-text-end]~ but I found this anime to be pretty deep~ even though it's aimed at children. I was surprised. P.S. I was so engrossed in RaiNet~ I couldn't do any practice swings with Samidare. I'm sorry...
Re:About RaiNet
Lukako
Now you're hooked on RaiNet? Everyone around me is buying into this RaiNet craze. How can it be so popular? Don't tell me it's an Organization plot!?
Re:About RaiNet
Lukako
That's your problem right there. You can't waste your time with romance fluff. If you have that much free time~ then practice with Samidare.
That game was fun
Lukako
That pager number guessing game was fun! I'd love to do it again sometime. Afterwards~ I asked my mom about what it was like when she was young~ and she looked so nostalgic. I don't know why she sighed so deeply~ though. ( ^ ^ * ) P.S. I did 10 practice swings with Samidare.
Summer plans
Lukako
Have you gone to any festivals or [ruby-base]fireworks shows[ruby-text-end] this summer? Maybe you have plans to go with [ruby-base]Mayuri[ruby-text-end]-chan later? P.S. I did 22 practice swings with Samidare.
Re:About summer plans
Lukako
No~ too crowded. I'm being chased by the Organization~ remember? The last thing I need is a knife in the back.
Re:About summer plans
Lukako
Hmm... I don't know Mayuri's plans~ but I'm pretty sure she's busy preparing for a different sort of festival soon to take place in Ariake.
About festivals
Lukako
I see... It's true festivals are very crowded. I was hoping I might run into you at one~ but I guess the chances of that were pretty slim to begin with. Ah~ it's not like I go to every festival. Please don't misunderstand. P.S. I only did 5 practice swings with Samidare...
About Mayuri-chan
Lukako
Um... you and Mayuri-chan don't go places together? You're both lab members~ and I heard you were childhood friends~ so I thought... I'm sorry if I misunderstood... P.S. I did 30 practice swings with Samidare.
Greetings
skyclad2010@egweb.ne.jp
This is Amane Suzuha. First email! Thanks for [ruby-base]exchanging addresses[ruby-text-end] with me yesterday. I finally made a friend [ruby-base]here[ruby-text-end]. Yay! Don't worry. I won't email you too much. And I might be [ruby-base]slow to reply[ruby-text-end] too. I'm kinda new at this email thing. It's okay to laugh at me!
Re:Greetings
skyclad2010@egweb.ne.jp
That wasn't an exchange. You took my address by force! I had no choice but to submit.
Re:Greetings
skyclad2010@egweb.ne.jp
Where were you living before?
Re:Greetings
skyclad2010@egweb.ne.jp
Haven't used cellphones much?
Actually
Part-Time Warrior
Actually~ it was [ruby-base]love at first sight[ruby-text-end]. lol jk~ jk. Actually~ I think that human beings [ruby-base]need relationships[ruby-text-end]~ you know? It's a matter of life and death.
Secret
Part-Time Warrior
That's a secret. Where do you think? If you get it right~ I'll take you anywhere. (Anywhere reachable by bicycle~ that is.) Take a guess! By the way~ no hints.
In the first place
Part-Time Warrior
I just got my first cellular phone [ruby-base]recently[ruby-text-end]. When I arrived in Tokyo a few days ago~ I didn't even know [ruby-base]how to ride the train[ruby-text-end]. So I just bought a [ruby-base]bike[ruby-text-end] instead.
Re:Actually
Part-Time Warrior
I understand. Women are always attracted to evil over good.
Re:Actually
Part-Time Warrior
Is that the rule you live by? It sounds like things haven't been easy for you~ Part-Time Warrior.
Re:In the first place
Part-Time Warrior
I can't believe there are still people our age who've never used a cellphone.
Re:In the first place
Part-Time Warrior
That has to be a joke. You're trolling me~ aren't you!
Re:In the first place
Part-Time Warrior
You must be pretty fit.
You're evil?
Part-Time Warrior
You're evil? The love at first sight thing was a joke~ okay? Are you by any chance a womanizer?
Words of wisdom?
Part-Time Warrior
Not really. I [ruby-base]don't like[ruby-text-end] relying on people. I can handle myself! (lmao) I guess it's a pride thing.
Directly
Part-Time Warrior
If you really want to talk to someone~ you should do it face-to-face. Too much is lost in an email. Honestly~ I'd rather be talking to you in person right now. Strange thing to say after demanding your address~ I know (lmao)
Actually
Part-Time Warrior
The train didn't run through where I lived. I was astonished to see how many train lines Tokyo had. It's like a big web!
Simple is best
Part-Time Warrior
Simple is best~ right? The bicycle's basic design hasn't changed for over 100 years. By the way~ I'm not that strong.
Re:Words of wisdom?
Part-Time Warrior
It's inconsistent to say that relationships are important but you don't like relying on others.
Hungry
Part-Time Warrior
I'm so hungry! I had to skip breakfast again today. I don't have much money on hand. Are there any good places to find [ruby-base]insects or weeds[ruby-text-end] around here? I can get by using my [ruby-base]survival skills[ruby-text-end] if I have to.
Re:Hungry
Part-Time Warrior
You eat insects? Hardcore....
Re:Hungry
Part-Time Warrior

Re:Re:Hungry

Part-Time Warrior

Akihabara's
Part-Time Warrior
Akihabara's such a strange town. Everywhere I look~ I see [ruby-base]drawings of cute girls[ruby-text-end]. Some of them even have their breasts fully exposed~ which startled me. Coming here has been a real [ruby-base]culture shock[ruby-text-end]. It's amazing how [ruby-base]peaceful[ruby-text-end] Japan is now.
Re:Akihabara's
Part-Time Warrior
Unfortunately~ moe has become the symbol of Akihabara and the chaos that rules here. Get used to it.
Re:Akihabara's
Part-Time Warrior
I can imagine how that would shock someone who isn't prepared.
Re:Akihabara's
Part-Time Warrior
I agree. It's all because of the Organization's efforts to stupidify Japan.
What's going on?
Part-Time Warrior
It sounds like you're [ruby-base]having fun[ruby-text-end] up there. Was that a girl's [ruby-base]scream[ruby-text-end] I heard? You're not doing [ruby-base]something dirty[ruby-text-end]~ are you? Do Tokyo people have loose sexual morals? I don't really understand that stuff.
Too much free time
Part-Time Warrior
But I'm so [ruby-base]bored[ruby-text-end]! There's nothing to do here all day. At least the [ruby-base]pay[ruby-text-end] is good... Ah~ don't [ruby-base]tell[ruby-text-end] the boss that I've been polishing my bicycle at work~ okay? I'll get fired. I hope you understand. We're in this together~ right?
Now~ on TV
Part-Time Warrior
Just now~ I saw two guys fighting on TV. I think it was some kind of competition. It really got my blood pumping! Hey~ mind if I come over and put you in a [ruby-base]straight arm bar[ruby-text-end]? It'll be fun!
Re:From above
Part-Time Warrior
What~ do you want to join the lab? Something tells me you're just looking for an excuse to skip work.
Re:From above
Part-Time Warrior
Don't worry. That wasn't a girl screaming.
Re:From above
Part-Time Warrior
It sounds like you have an overactive imagination. Or is it wishful thinking~ I wonder?
Re:Too much free time
Part-Time Warrior
What do you mean ″but?″ What are you talking about?
Re:Too much free time
Part-Time Warrior
What? The Braun Tube Workshop pays well? Maybe I'll apply for a part time job in September.
Re:Too much free time
Part-Time Warrior
Ha! You've made a fatal mistake! You exposed your own weakness to me! I'll be saving this trump card for the critical moment.
Re:Now~ on TV
Part-Time Warrior
Command sambo!? So you are an Organization assassin!
After
Part-Time Warrior
I might be [ruby-base]quitting[ruby-text-end] in two days. Don't tell the boss~ okay? He'll kill me.
Re:Re:Policeman
Part-Time Warrior
Oh... By the way~ what's a yakuza? Also~ do you know where I can find a gun? Just wondering.
Re:Re:Nae
Part-Time Warrior
Nae says you're scary (lmao) She likes me~ though! It's nice~ like having a little sister. Gotta take care of her! Plus she's my excuse to skip work (lmao)
History
Part-Time Warrior
″Pivotal moments in history are rarely seen as such until long after they have occurred. Even the person responsible for the change may not realize what he has done.″ --Amane Suzuha~ 2010.
Earlier when I was working
Part-Time Warrior
The last time I fell asleep at work~ the boss woke me up with his fist. Ow! Well~ no one to blame but myself.
Riding a bicycle
Part-Time Warrior
I've said that riding a bicycle is fun~ right? But I got muscle pain from it. Despite appearances~ I have a [ruby-base]weak constitution[ruby-text-end].
Re:Russia
Part-Time Warrior
That's from Russia~ right? All I know about Russia are those cute dolls. I've never been.
Re:After
Part-Time Warrior
You're quitting? Don't be hasty. He really will kill you!
Re:Riding a bicycle
Part-Time Warrior
This is the taste of a liar.
Oneself
Part-Time Warrior
It's easy to pretend to be someone you're not. Ultimately~ however~ there's no escaping the contradictions between your [ruby-base]false self[ruby-text-end] and the real you. It's a paradox~ and paradoxes can't hold. I tried to tell myself that I didn't need anyone~ that forming bonds would only hurt~ but somehow I ended up joining your circle of friends. I still don't know if it was for the best. No~ I'm sure it was. Without you~ I would have given up on ever finding my dad. I don't know why I wrote all this. I guess what I'm trying to say is... thanks.
Re:Oneself
Part-Time Warrior
Are we sharing confessions now? Be careful to whom you expose your innermost feelings. They may use them against you!
Re:Re:Oneself
Part-Time Warrior
Don't forget what Titor said.
The final battle is close at hand nya
Faris
You're more [ruby-base]purrceptive[ruby-text-end] than I thought~ nya. So now you understand what's at stake. The [ruby-base]Red Southern Cross[ruby-text-end] will soon [ruby-base]hatch[ruby-text-end]~ nya. The time has come for Faris to journey to the Sanctuary and prepare for... I can say no more~ nya...
Re:The decisive battle is close at hand nya
Faris
What are you talking about? Will you quit testing me with this mockery?
Re:The decisive battle is close at hand nya
Faris
I see. So the Holders of Original Sin -- those who~ like me~ were born of Prototype 13 -- have begun to assemble in Akiba~ guided by the star that we alone can see. The time is right.
Re:The decisive battle is close at hand nya
Faris
Impossible. You mean it's already awakening? It's 50 years earlier than I predicted. What does this mean!?
You can't fool me~ nya
Faris
You know exactly what I mean~ nya. Why do you think I approached you~ Kyouma? The Story has already come to life~ nya. I must to prepare you for what you must face. That's my role as the Guide~ nya.
So that was it after all nya
Faris
The Holders of Original Sin~ also known as the Prophets~ nya. Among them is the girl known as ″the Fallen Angel who Accepted Chaos~″ nya. I attached a picture of her face~ so rememburr it well~ nya. Oh~ and before I furrget~ looking at the picture without protection will cause Divine Eye to activate Original Sin Excitation (Mode 666: Compulsory Receptor Release) which will annihilate you at the subatomic level. So be careful~ nya!
It's already a state of emergency nya
Faris
That's why you need to locate ″the 14th man″ as soon as possible~ nya. He must be in the Hawk's Nest~ also known as Eagle Prison~ which exists somewhere in Akiba.
Original Sin level rising to 180%
Faris
Kyouma... when operating in the [ruby-base]Mundane World[ruby-text-end]~ you're supposed to be [ruby-base]discrete~[ruby-text-end] nya. You don't want Them to notice you. Remember~ the summoning has taken [ruby-base]2000[ruby-text-end] years to prepare. If it fails~ everything will be ruined... although I suppose that might make things [ruby-base]interesting[ruby-text-end]~ nyahaha.
Re:Original Sin level rising to 180%
Faris
Akiba~ part of the Mundane World? Nonsense. This town has belonged to Chaos for centuries. As it shall forevermore.
Re:Original Sin level rising to 180%
Faris
Are you suggesting that I~ the great Hououin Kyouma~ run and hide? You risk my ire~ catgirl.
Re:Original Sin level rising to 180%
Faris
Is the Church still devoted to that fool's errand? Even if they manage to resurrect their Messiah~ humanity's faith is less than 17% of what it was in his time. Mankind doesn't need decrepit old gods to save them.
Re:Original Sin level rising to 180%
Faris
You... what are you scheming?
The truth of the world
Faris
I didn't say anything about Akiba~ nya. If you want to learn the Truth of the World~ then come to me at once~ nya. It's time for the prelude to ruin~ the grand banquet to begin!
Unreasonyable!
Faris
Don't tell me you plan to face them head on? But that will turn Akiba into a sea of blood~ nyan! Restrain yourself~ Kyouma!
Song of Prophecy
Faris
But the fallen angel~ FES~ prophesied His resurrection in her song Esoteric Choker~ nyan. This song is the cat's meow♪ I found a copy of the album she put out back in her indie days (had to pay through the whiskers for it)~ and faithfully decoded each song of prophecy regarding Judgment Day~ nya.

Faris
Doth thou desire Chaos~ nya?(¯ー¯)
PHANTASM is the cat's meow♪
Faris
Have you bought [ruby-base]PHANTASM[ruby-text-end]'s debut single~ nya? It's the [ruby-base]theme song[ruby-text-end] for ″RaiNet Kakeru~″ so it's really popular. Faris bought five copies~ nya. It's my duty as a RaiNetter! Anyway~ there's an [ruby-base]important secret[ruby-text-end] hidden in PHANTASM's songs. The key to unlocking it is... oops~ the bell's ringing~ nya. Looks like someone's here. Better see who it is.
Re:PHANTASM is the cat's meow♪
Faris
That band's vocalist... I feel a strong resonance from her.
Re:PHANTASM is the cat's meow♪
Faris
Is this another part of Operation Stupidify Humanity? Explain.
Re:PHANTASM is the cat's meow♪
Faris
I'm aware. They are said to contain directions to the Sanctuary~ as well as prophesies regarding the end of the world. Isn't that right?
The vocalist is a beautiful girl
Faris
The vocalist~ FES~ is also known as the ″Fallen Angel who Accepted [ruby-base]Chaos[ruby-text-end]″ and ″[ruby-base]Cocytus[ruby-text-end] Force Raid.″ Her [ruby-base]atmosphere[ruby-text-end] has changed a little since her indie days.
RaiNet OP 2
Faris
[ruby-base]RaiNet Kakeru[ruby-text-end]'s second opening theme~ nya. First played in ep 14~ nyan. It's super cool~ nya! Looks like it made big news last year in [ruby-base]Shibuya[ruby-text-end]'s indie scene~ but I never thought she'd make a major debut~ nya.
Exactamundo
Faris
Her songs still contain words of [ruby-base]prophecy[ruby-text-end]. Before [ruby-base]they[ruby-text-end] reach it~ Faris must decipher the prophecies to find the location of the [ruby-base]Holy Lan[ruby-text-end]~ nya!
Re:The vocalist is a beautiful girl
Faris
Become chaos. Bearing an endless pain.
Re:The vocalist is a beautiful girl
Faris
Sounds like a power that could kill you dead.
Re:The vocalist is a beautiful girl
Faris
Did society defile her and make her a literal fallen angel? Chaos has lost a powerful ally.
Re:RaiNet OP 2
Faris
Speaking of which~ Mayuri loves that show. Is it even popular with teenage girls?
Re:RaiNet OP 2
Faris
That land... has provoked the wrath of god....
Re:Exactamundo
Faris
Mind telling me what's in those songs? Remember: if you refuse~ I have ways of making you talk.
Re:Exactamundo
Faris
There's no need to put yourself in such danger. Retreat immediately!
Re:Exactamundo
Faris
The Sanctuary has been lost for 300 years. It's pointless to seek it now.
Re:Re:The vocalist is a beautiful girl
Faris
Become chaos~ nya.
Re:Re:The vocalist is a beautiful girl
Faris
Super dead~ nya.
Human growth?
Faris
She used to be kinda scary~ nya. Cold as ice~ nyan. But I hear that she sometimes smiles on stage now~ nya! FES-sama's smile! I wanna see her smile~ nya. But I don't want the media to defile her with their grubby paws~ nya.
RaiNet Ep 13
Faris
I sent you a rundown of episode 13 so you can see what it's like~ nya. I'll lend you the DVD sometime~ nya! Ah~ but it might be quicker to borrow it from Mayushii~ nyan.
Revelations
Faris
I can't give details~ nya. But her songs are divine revelations~ prophesies of the end of the world~ nya.
Judgment Day
Faris
I can't stop now~ nya. Judgment Day is near. I have to keep going~ nya. I must find the Sanctuary. That is where Faris belongs~ nyan.
Eternally exists
Faris
What's that supposed to mean~ nya!? The Sanctuary must be there! If it isn't... then what will happen to Faris's brother!?
Sign of increasing misfortune
Faris
Oh no! [ruby-base]He[ruby-text-end] escaped~ nya! If we don't find him and kill him~ misfortune will fall upon Akiba~ nya! His name is ″The End of Chutorial.″ He's small~ and nimble~ and he cries ″chuu chuu~″ nya! Come here quick! Faris needs your [ruby-base]help[ruby-text-end]~ nyan!
Re:Sign of increasing misfortune
Faris
A rat? What kind of catgirl is afraid of rats? You disappoint me~ Faris NyanNyan!
Re:Sign of increasing misfortune
Faris
I can help~ but it won't be cheap.
About abilities
Faris
There's a lot I don't know about myself~ nya.  Why does Faris have [ruby-base]cat ears[ruby-text-end] when other people have people ears? Why can Faris only speak in [ruby-base]NyanNyanian[ruby-text-end]? Where is my home~ the [ruby-base]Chinchilla Star[ruby-text-end]? I want to know the truth. That's why I have to go~ nya! To where all the answers can be found!
Cat-astrophe nya...
Faris
I told you~ it's [ruby-base]too late[ruby-text-end]~ nya!
Re:About abilities
Faris
Half-human~ half-demon... I want to take you back to the lab and run some experiments. Do you mind?
Re:About abilities
Faris
Quit talking like that. It's annoying.
Re:About abilities
Faris
Too bad. Your homeworld has already fallen to the great Hououin Kyouma. Muhahaha!
Re:Cat-astrophe nya...
Faris
Too late? What are you talking about? You haven't told me anything.

Faris
A cat's paws are made of warmth and joy. Sorry I couldn't come today~ nya.

Re:Re:Ep 8
Faris
Sorry I couldn't come today~ nya. Faris was practicing for the RaiNet AB grand championships~ nyan. I want to crush my enemies just like in [ruby-base]Ep 8[ruby-text-end]~ nya.

ComiMa
Faris
Is Mayushii okay? Tell her to have fun at ComiMa for me. I don't think I can go this year~ nyan. I just don't have the [ruby-base]energy[ruby-text-end]~ nya. I'm completely burned out... I can hear a voice shouting ″get up~ Joe″... nyan.... Someone... [ruby-base]save[ruby-text-end] me.... The world... is [ruby-base]collapsing[ruby-text-end]~ nya....
Re:ComiMa
Faris
That's not like you. Pull yourself together. I need your help finding the IBN 5100.
Re:ComiMa
Faris
What happened? Is the Organization attacking!?
Re:ComiMa
Faris
You're messing with me again~ aren't you? Stop making me worry!
Re:Re:ComiMa
Faris
I was forcing myself to be cheerful for that last phone call~ nya... I actually feel like I could die~ nya...
Re:Re:ComiMa
Faris
My life has no meaning. It's all gone now. No one will look at me. Not anymore. What can I do? Even if I shout~ no one can hear. My voice can't reach the one most important to me. I walk alone through dusty gray streets~ forever pounded by lukewarm rain. Such is the fate of the defeated. Still... Faris is here. [ruby-base]Someone find me[ruby-text-end].
Re:Re:ComiMa
Faris
When I listen to PHANTASM's songs at times like these~ I sink even deeper into the darkness~ nya... Join me~ Kyouma.
Get a grip
Faris
What chuuni nonsense. If you want attention~ come to the lab. Mayuri and I are here for you.

I've confirmed that divergence is currently 0.523299%. I cannot tell what the value was before you changed the past.

That's been proven by my own experience. But in the case of an email like the one you sent~ the ″time traveler″ changes the past without actually traveling through time~ a situation that scientists in my time never even considered.
