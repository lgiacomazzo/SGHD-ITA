The night of the 17th passed. The night of the 18th passed. And Mayuri still didn’t die.[%p]
I’ve kept a close watch for three days since then. There have been no attacks, no accidents, no sign that anything might happen. That was enough to convince me that Mayuri is safe.[%p]
Together with Daru, I destroyed the Microonde Telefonico and the IBN 5100.[%p]
Although we have lost the ability to send D-Mails, that is a small price to pay to stay below SERN’s radar.[%p]
Tennouji is downstairs in the Braun Tube Workshop, watching TV on the 42-inch CRT, like always.[%p]
When I went to check out Radio Kaikan, I found it open for business as usual.[%p]
A search of the internet turned up no mention of a satellite crash.[%p]
Instead, I found a small article in the local section of a newspaper dated July 28th.[%p]
It was a report on Kurisu’s murder.[%p]
There was no follow-up. The culprit is still at large.[%p]
According to Daru, the police questioned me several times. It was I who discovered the body, after all.[%p]
Of course, I don’t remember any of that.[%p]
At any rate, Mayuri is still alive.[%p]
I’ve accomplished what I set out to do.[%p]
It’s over.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin♪”[%p]
Mayuri emerges from the ticket gate, waving her hand as she runs my way.[%p]
She weaves through the gaps between shoppers and maids handing out leaflets. And when she gets to me, she looks at me with puppy-dog eyes.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ah... sniff...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wh-why are you crying!?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...”[%p]
Mayuri doesn’t answer me. She just strokes my cheek. Gently. Silently.[%p]
She’s crying, but she doesn’t seem sad. Rather, she seems overcome with emotion.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin came to pick me up...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You waited for Mayushii... I’m so happy!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t get so happy over every little thing.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehehe♪”[%p]
Mayuri wipes away her tears, making room for her shy, innocent smile.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So Mayushii class-changed from Hostage to Girlfriend, right?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Indeed.”[%p]
I have no idea how to respond to such an embarrassing question.[%p]
But she’s right. Mayuri and I are officially a couple.[%p]
After these long, painful twenty days, I finally noticed how important Mayuri is to me. Plus, she told me that she loved me.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Thank goodness... It wasn’t just a dream.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s get going, already. I’m gonna die standing in this damn heat.”[%p]
I start walking without waiting for Mayuri’s response.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But the lab’s hot too, isn’t it?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“At least we’ve got a fan. And besides, I’m thirsty. Gotta get my daily dose of Dr P.”[%p]
It’s Sunday.[%p]
Despite the heat, I see plenty of shoppers laden with bags enjoying themselves on the streets of Akiba.[%p]
I suddenly feel a void in my heart.[%p]
Nothing about this town has changed.[%p]
Yet it feels like something is missing from my life.[%p]
No doubt it’s the gap that was left by Kurisu.[%p]
But there’s no such thing as a perfect future.[%p]
That is a fantasy that nobody can realize.[%p]
I mustn’t forget.[%p]
This is the future I wished for, fought for, and won.[%p]
I have what is most important to me. Mayuri.[%p]
I should be thankful for that.[%p]
I am blessed far beyond the common man.[%p]
I look beside me and realize that Mayuri’s not there.[%p]
I turn around. She’s not there either.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri?”[%p]
She’s gone.[%p]
She’s always like this.[%p]
Sometimes she just wanders off.[%p]
Anxiety seizes my heart.[%p]
Mayuri promised she would never leave me.[%p]
This worldline is worthless without her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri!”[%p]
I shout her name at the top of my lungs.[%p]
I search for her in the crowd, but it’s too thick to see.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Over here!”[%p]
I turn around to see Mayuri running towards me.[%p]
In her hands... is shaved ice.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehehe♪ You said it was hot, remember? I thought it’d be nice to eat something cold!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t scare me like that!”[%p]
I feel so relieved, I want to embrace that small body of hers. But we’re in public, so I stop myself.[%p]
I take the shaved ice and hold my empty hand out to Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hold my hand.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okay.”[%p]
Mayuri takes my hand.[%p]
Her slender fingers intertwine with mine.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s save the shaved ice for when we get to the lab. It’s too hard to eat while walking.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehh? But won’t it melt?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“If it melts, it melts.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh... well, I guess you’re right. We can’t eat if we’re holding hands, anyway.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I won’t let go! I won’t ever let you go!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii won’t let go either♪”[%p]
Mayuri puts just a little more strength into her grip.[%p]
Love for her fills my heart.[%p]
Suddenly, Mayuri looks up at Radio Kaikan.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Is it possible to dream when you’re awake?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“When you’re awake? You mean a daydream?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Is that what it’s called? You’re so smart!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, I don’t know who it was, but Mayushii feels like she had a very important friend.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What...?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And whenever I think about that important friend, my heart hurts, like [color index="A0140000"]hnng[color index="800000"], you know?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And sometimes, I hear a voice.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“A... voice?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“The voice tells me to ’find happiness.’”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah...”[%p]
All of that was undone.[%p]
I erased those memories. Sacrificed them.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I wonder if that voice is the reason Mayushii’s with Okarin now...”[%p]
Perhaps everybody remembers their experiences from other worldlines.[%p]
Those memories may be vague and tenuous, but they’re there.[%p]
They speak to us in the form of dreams, visions, and deja vu.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“If I ever meet that person, I want to tell them thanks.”[%p]
I’m not the only one who remembers.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I wonder who it was.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...It must have been God.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh... well, thanks, God!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii’s really happy.”[%p]
Mayuri looks up.[%p]
She reaches out to the sky, like always.[%p]
She shakes hands with the stardust, twinkling beyond the coat of blue.[%p]
I look up too, to hold back the tears.[%p]
And on we walk, hand in hand.[%p]
