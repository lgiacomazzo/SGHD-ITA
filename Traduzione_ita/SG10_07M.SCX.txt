I contacted Kurisu. We arranged to meet on the UPX overpass at 4:30 in the morning.[%p]
I was wondering why she wanted to meet so early. But I understand once I see her.[%p]
She’s dragging a large suitcase.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Thanks for coming to see me off.”[%p]
She faces us with a smile.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Does that suitcase mean what I think it does?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Hm? Oh. Yeah, it does.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re going back to America.”[%p]
Kurisu nods.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I was supposed to go back at the beginning of the month. But then I ran into a certain mad scientist, and ended up staying longer than planned.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“There’s nothing else I can help you with anyway. And I don’t want to be a liability.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Is she doing this for me?[%p]
Or is she trying to outrun her fear?[%p]
It’s not my right to stop her. Even if I did, it wouldn’t change anything.[%p]
Today, as planned, I will crack SERN’s database and move to the Beta linea di universo.[%p]
I’ve made my decision.[%p]
Mayuri is next to me, standing still with her head hung.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“What’s wrong, Mayuri? Are you feeling sick?”[%p]
I gently nudge her back.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“C’mon, Mayuri.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...”[%p]
She takes one step, pauses for a second, then leaps on Kurisu with a cry.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Chris-chan!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“W-whoa, what’s going on!?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii doesn’t want Chris-chan to disappear!”[%p]
Kurisu hears the desperate plea in Mayuri’s voice. She gives me a look that asks, “Did you tell her?”[%p]
I silently nod.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You can’t disappear. Not for Mayushii! Okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii doesn’t want to live if Chris-chan has to die!”[%p]
I expected Mayuri might say that.[%p]
It’s absolutely essential that I remain firm.[%p]
I feel bad for Kurisu, but it needs to be said.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is the way it has to be. I chose you, Mayuri. You have an [color index="A0140000"]obligation[color index="800000"] to live.”[%p]
Pain stabs through my heart.[%p]
These words are reprehensible.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kurisu and I made a pact. She agreed to trade her life for yours. If that sacred covenant is broken, this world is doomed!”[%p]
I clench my fists tight to suppress my self-loathing.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Don’t put Kurisu’s feelings to waste, Mayuri!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But... but...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Thank you, Mayuri.”[%p]
Kurisu wraps her arms around Mayuri’s back, returning the hug.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But this was my decision too. I’m okay with it. Really.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe loves you, you know.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Wha...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wh-wh-wha-what are you saying!?”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It’s true, isn’t it?”[%p]
She gives me a mischievous smile.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“It would make him really sad if you died. You don’t want him to be sad, do you?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But if Chris-chan goes away, it’ll make Mayushii sad...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Yeah... I know. It makes me sad too.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“But this was going to happen eventually. I had to go back to America sooner or later.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“So even if you move to another linea di universo, just think of me as being in America. It’s practically the same thing.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That’s not the problem! I don’t want Chris-chan to disappear!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Let’s stop this, okay? Don’t make Chris-chan disappear!”[%p]
Kurisu separates from Mayuri, and gazes straight into her face.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You have to listen to us now, Mayuri.”[%p]
She uses a gentle tone, as if speaking to a child.[%p]
Then she lightly bumps Mayuri on the head.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Okabe. Don’t ever let go of her again.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...I know.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Well, I’m off.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Thank god I’ll never have to see your silly face again!”[%p]
She punctuates her insult with a smile.[%p]
She’s so cheerful now, a far cry from the shivering girl in the dark. To see her like this breaks my heart.[%p]
I’m sorry.[%p]
I repeat the words in my heart again and again, begging for forgiveness.[%p]
Kurisu turns to go.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Don’t go, Chris-chan! Please, don’t go!”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Don’t follow me!”[%p]
She shouts over her shoulder. Mayuri freezes.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I don’t want pity. It will only make it worse.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“This is my decision. Nothing you can say will change my mind.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...Goodbye.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Promise me, Mayuri. Promise me you’ll find happiness.”[%p]
With that, Kurisu walks away.[%p]
Early morning Akihabara, well before sunrise. The trains are just starting to run.[%p]
She disappears into the station, dragging her suitcase behind her, alone.[%p]
Mayuri falls to her knees, her face streaked with tears.[%p]
As I approach, I hear her voice.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’m sorry... I’m sorry... I’m sorry...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You have nothing to apologize for. This was my decision, and mine alone.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Kurisu will disappear, for I chose not to save her.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I chose... to bring chaos to the world.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You can’t forgive me, can you, Mayuri? Then hate me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But even then, you’re staying with me to the end.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I have chosen.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“To save you, I will let Kurisu die.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So hate me, loathe me, curse my name...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“But I... will not turn back.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nobody can stop me now.”[%p]
Mayuri slowly stands up.[%p]
Then she buries her face into my chest, just like she did to Kurisu.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Sniff... Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Tell me how you really feel...”[%p]
How I... really feel?[%p]
Mayuri looks straight up into my eyes.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I want to know what’s in your heart... your honest feelings...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii doesn’t want to be a burden any more.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re not a burden! How can you think that!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is about me. Because [color index="A0140000"]I[color index="800000"] want to save you, because [color index="A0140000"]I[color index="800000"] can’t bear to lose you!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yeah... Thank you, Okarin... thank you...”[%p]
Mayuri tries her hardest to smile through her tears.[%p]
And then, once again, she buries her face into my chest.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I’ve been having scary dreams lately.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“In those dreams, you always try to save me.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“They weren’t dreams, were they?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You were fighting to save Mayushii, weren’t you?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, Okarin? You know...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii loves you.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii can smile every day because you’re there for me.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Can we be together from now on, too?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course.”[%p]
I answer Mayuri with my embrace.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How can you ask that?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t want to be apart from you either!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yeah...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii will find happiness.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Just like I promised Chris-chan.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Let’s be happy together...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We will.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Never let go of me...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I won’t!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Let me love you forever...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Of course.”[%p]
The radiance of the rising sun pours out between the buildings.[%p]
Daybreak.[%p]
As the sky grows brighter, we remain in our embrace, as if to reassure each other that we are still here.[%p]
