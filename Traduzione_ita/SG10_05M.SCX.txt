[name]Rintaro[line]“...I’m sorry.”[%p]
A meaningless apology.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I want to save Mayuri... more than anything.”[%p]
These words are a death sentence, but I force myself to speak them. It takes every ounce of willpower I possess.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I... can’t save you.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“...I know.”[%p]
When I finish, I feel as if a great weight has left my shoulders.[%p]
And at the same time, as if a thousand needles are stabbing into my heart.[%p]
Kurisu weakly returns my embrace.[%p]
Then she lets go and stands up.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Well then.”[%p]
There’s already a look of relief on her face.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“I’m heading back.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Back? Where?”[%p]
...To America?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]”The lab, of course. I need to dry my clothes. I wanna take a shower, too.”[%p]
In that case, we should go back together.[%p]
But before I can suggest it, Kurisu beats me to the punch, as if she read my mind.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“You stay here and soak for a while.”[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]“Understand?”[%p]
We can’t go back together.[%p]
That’s her verdict.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Understand.”[%p]
I hang my head and shut my eyes.[%p]
Kurisu’s footsteps fade into the distance.[%p]
I wrap my arms around my body.[%p]
Even though it’s summer and sweltering hot, I can’t stop my body from shaking.[%p]
I realize that part of me is relieved that Kurisu left alone. At least I won’t have to face her again, to look upon the face of the girl I chose to die.[%p]
I’m a coward.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh... heh heh heh...”[%p]
My self-loathing echoes in the darkness.[%p]
