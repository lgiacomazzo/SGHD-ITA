I wait about two hours before returning to the lab. Kurisu is already gone when I get there.[%p]
All she left is a single email.[%p]
I sit down on the sofa. While drying my hair with a towel, I look towards the PC in the corner of the room.[%p]
It’s already connected to the IBN 5100, ready for Daru to start hacking.[%p]
I already got in touch with him. The hacking starts tomorrow at noon.[%p]
I drove myself even further into a corner by telling that to Daru. Now I can’t turn back, no matter how much I want to.[%p]
I chose Mayuri.[%p]
I will let Kurisu die.[%p]
Showering didn’t soften the wrenching pain in my heart.[%p]
In truth, I’m just riding on Kurisu’s resolve. Mine is still a flimsy thing.[%p]
I can’t help but wonder, is this really okay?[%p]
...Really?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Anyone here?”[%p]
Mayuri opens the door and enters.[%p]
For a moment after she catches sight of me, she looks ready to burst into tears.[%p]
But that quickly gives way to a smile.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“It’s Okarin!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What’s up?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh, nothing. I just decided to stop by. Ehehe♪”[%p]
I swallow hard.[%p]
Maybe I should explain the situation to Mayuri.[%p]
But I know she’ll feel guilty if I tell her.[%p]
Mayuri doesn’t need to know.[%p]
Everything will be okay as long as we crack SERN’s database and reach the Beta worldline.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You know, I haven’t talked much with Okarin lately.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But you know, I don’t want to be a burden on Okarin.”[%p]
Can I really let it end like this?[%p]
Shouldn’t I tell her what Kurisu is sacrificing for her sake?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Did you take a shower?”[%p]
Mayuri moves behind the sofa, grabs the bath towel on my head, and starts rubbing my hair dry.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You smell good, like shampoo.”[%p]
I didn’t mind the towel so much, but then she buries her nose into my hair and starts sniffing.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“S-stop that!”[%p]
I jerk my head away.[%p]
Mayuri goes back to drying my hair.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You know... I didn’t go to ComiMa today.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hm? Why?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I was thinking about Okarin.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]”When I got to Ariake, I remembered how sad you looked, and then I thought, ’I shouldn’t be having fun at ComiMa.’” [%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So I turned around and came all the way back.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh... Sorry for making you worry.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...”[%p]
Should I tell her?[%p]
Or should I keep her in the dark?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You know, I haven’t talked much with Okarin lately.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Maybe Mayushii’s getting a little lonely.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri. How would you feel... if I said I was keeping a secret from you?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You mean like... Okarin and Chris-chan are actually dating?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where did that come from?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin and Chris-chan get along really well, right? I think you two are meant for each other.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...No, it’s nothing like that.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh... okay...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You don’t have to tell me everything, if you don’t want to.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Besides, it’s normal to keep secrets from your hostage.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This isn’t the time for that!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...”[%p]
Mayuri’s hand leaves my head.[%p]
I look over my shoulder in a panic, thinking she wandered off again.[%p]
She’s there. I grab her hand, perhaps more forcefully than I meant to.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...Mayushii doesn’t want to be a burden.”[%p]
Again.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So I’ll wait until Okarin’s ready to tell me.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Just like I said yesterday, remember?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...And if decide to never tell you?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Well, I’d be curious... really curious... but if that’s what you want...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Even if my secret involves you?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I haven’t told you because I don’t want to hurt you.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...Is that why Okarin looks so sad all the time?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, then I do want to know.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I don’t like it when Okarin’s sad.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Even if it means you might get hurt?”[%p]
Mayuri replies...[%p]
With a gentle smile.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
She nods without any hesitation. Her smile is so sincere, it strikes me speechless.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii doesn’t want to be a burden.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“When Mayushii was sad because of what happened to Granny, Okarin took Mayushii hostage, remember?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That’s why Mayushii always thought. That whenever Okarin’s sad, she could lend her strength to him, you know?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii might not be useful, though...”[%p]
Useful...[%p]
Suddenly, I remember.[%p]
Mayuri is going to die tomorrow.[%p]
I’ve been through it once before.[%p]
She died protecting me, and her last words were...[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Finally... Mayushii was...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“useful... to Okarin...”[%p]
So this is what she meant.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I don’t want to see you hurting...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Very well.”[%p]
If that’s how she feels...[%p]
I’ll tell her everything.[%p]
I let go of Mayuri’s hand and pat the sofa beside me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Take a seat.”[%p]
Mayuri does as she’s told.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, can I get some snacks?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is serious, remember?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh... right.”[%p]
Mayuri sits up straight with her hands folded in her lap.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okay, ready.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Everything I’m about to tell you is true. It’s related to those dreams you had.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I plan to sacrifice one of our friends for your sake.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Eh? Okarin?”[%p]
Anxiety clouds Mayuri’s face, but I ignore it and take her chin in my fingers.[%p]
A switch has already flipped inside of me.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Heh heh heh... you will soon regret your curiosity, my dear. For the deeds of the great Hououin Kyouma are many and terrible! Muhahaha!”[%p]
And so I begin, speaking as the mad scientist whose foolish experiments brought everything to ruin.[%p]
I start with the first raid on the lab. I tell Mayuri how Moeka killed her.[%p]
Next, I tell her about Suzuha and Faris, about Lukako, Moeka, FB, and Nae. I describe their fates in every detail.[%p]
And finally... I tell her about Kurisu.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“By sacrificing Makise Kurisu, I will embark upon a journey to a glorious new world!”[%p]
There was a lot to explain, and Mayuri kept asking questions, desperate to understand the strange concepts I was throwing at her.[%p]
Thanks to that, the conversation went longer than expected. It’s already getting late.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And that is the plan most grand and devious of the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma! I call it... Made in Heaven! Muhahahaha!”[%p]
Finally, it’s over.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...”[%p]
Mayuri says nothing. She’s staring at her hands, which are clenched into tiny, trembling fists. [%p]
She looks ready to cry any second.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...What’s the matter?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...”[%p]
Mayuri shakes her head and bites her lip.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“The whole time you and Chris-chan were hurting...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii was making costumes... like nothing was wrong...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I feel so stupid!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I didn’t know anything!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“O-of course you didn’t! That’s how I planned it.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]”Are you disappointed in me, Mayuri? Sorry, but this is who I am. I will do anything, sacrifice anyone to accomplish my goals. Whether you like it our not, you’re coming with me to the Beta worldline.” [%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re my hostage, and you have no say in the matter. Heh heh heh!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let chaos descend upon the world! That is the scelta di Steins Gate!”[%p]
Mayuri ignores my performance. She gets to her feet and lurches towards the door.[%p]
I quickly grab her by the wrist.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where are you going!?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I need to see Chris-chan!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Please, Okarin. I have to talk to her!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
There’s no way I can refuse Mayuri’s request.[%p]
