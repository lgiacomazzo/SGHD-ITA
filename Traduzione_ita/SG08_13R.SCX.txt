The first day of ComiMa has ended.[%p]
A few otaku warriors linger to check their spoils before beginning the odyssey home. Otherwise, Ariake is silent and still, as if the crowd Lukako and I saw this afternoon was a lie.[%p]
ComiMa runs for three days straight, but it already feels like the end of a festival.[%p]
Of course, this silence is just for tonight. Tomorrow, people will come to fill this spacious promenade once again.[%p]
My hand clutches at my chest.[%p]
Mayuri will die in less than an hour. I’m not ready.[%p]
Even so, I want to be with her in her final moments.[%p]
I won’t let her leave this world alone.[%p]
That’s why I came here right after leaving the shrine.[%p]
She should still be in Ariake somewhere.[%p]
I contacted both Mayuri and Daru by mail.[%p]
If they’re still in Ariake, they should be here any minute now.[%p]
My phone rings. Speak of the devil.[%p]
However, the name on the display isn’t the one I was expecting.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Lukako...”[%p]
She doesn’t have to say it. I know exactly what she means.[%p]
There’s only one thing I can say.[%p]
“This was my choice. You don’t have to worry about a thing.”[%p]
I know that mail won’t be enough to stop Lukako from blaming herself.[%p]
But I have to send it all the same, if only to strengthen my own resolve.[%p]
Memories from this morning rise unbidden.[%p]
Mayuri stopped by the lab on the way to ComiMa. I was dozing on the couch...[%p]
Suddenly, the darkness was burned away by light.[%p]
Squinting against the fluorescent radiance, I raised my head to see who had entered.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Sorry, Okarin. Did I wake you up?”[%p]
Mayuri was there, tugging a suitcase.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, I wasn’t really asleep.”[%p]
I’d been up all night, trying to solve the problem of my last date with Lukako.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You’re pretty early, Mayuri.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Actually, Mayushii’s here to pick up her costumes.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And breakfast!”[%p]
She took a sandwich and some potato salad from her convenience store bag.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you going to ComiMa now?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yeah♪ Daru-kun already left on the first bus.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, Okarin. Where’d you go with Luka-chan yesterday?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Did you have a fun date? You know, Luka-chan hasn’t replied to my mails since yesterday.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You emailed Lukako?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yeah. Mayushii’s a little worried, you know.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
The day before, Lukako burst into tears barely five minutes after we met up. Then we parted ways.[%p]
That’s why I couldn’t give Mayuri an answer.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Did you make Luka-chan cry again? That would make Mayushii sad...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...Sad?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Sad. Luka-chan is Mayushii’s friend.”[%p]
It was Mayuri’s last day alive, and also Lukako’s last day together with me.[%p]
I asked myself, could I really let it end with both of them sad?[%p]
Let it end?[%p]
What right did I have to decide when it ends? My arrogance made me want to vomit.[%p]
And then, as if to rely on Mayuri, I began to tell her my new plan.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you going to be at ComiMa all day?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Eh? Yeah, why?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Is it okay if I bring Lukako?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Really? Of course it’s okay!”[%p]
Mayuri smiled happily, took some milk out of the refrigerator to wash down the sandwich, and began to enjoy her breakfast.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You tried asking Lukako to cosplay, right? How’d it go?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Well... I couldn’t convince her”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I don’t want to force her, you know. That would make her hate cosplay!”[%p]
So basically, she gave up.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“But you know, it might be a good idea to bring Luka-chan to ComiMa.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You think maybe if she saw other cosplayers having fun, Luka-chan might want to try it too?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Do you think we could get her to cosplay at the next ComiMa?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I wonder.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That would be nice.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, will you really bring Luka-chan over today?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Will you come too, and look at the costumes Mayushii made?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Yes, I will.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yay♪ That would make me really happy!”[%p]
Mayuri packed her costumes into the suitcase.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Welp, gotta get going.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Be sure to come, okay? I’ll be waiting. I’ll show you all the best stuff so you’ll want to come tomorrow too!”[%p]
I could hear my teeth grinding.[%p]
I knew that whether Mayuri would get to see tomorrow depended entirely on my actions.[%p]
If this day had gone as planned, my status as Lukako’s temporary boyfriend would have come to a close.[%p]
Lukako would have gone back to being a guy.[%p]
Mayuri would survive the night.[%p]
She would go to ComiMa tomorrow without a care in the world.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin? Something wrong?”[%p]
Mayuri looked at me quizzically.[%p]
She’s always been sensitive to changes in my demeanor.[%p]
So I put on a smile and responded as Hououin Kyouma.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Nothing’s wrong. Just thinking up ways to defeat l’Organizzazione.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s meet in Ariake in the afternoon.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okay. I’ll be waiting.”[%p]
Mayuri didn’t leave right away.[%p]
She just stood there in front of the door, looking at me.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii’s always here for you to talk to when you need her, okay?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehehe! I’m off!”[%p]
Mayuri cheerfully flew out the door, suitcase in hand, like the white rabbit in Wonderland.[%p]
The sound of her footsteps gradually faded away.[%p]
Now alone, I took a deep breath.[%p]
The time limit was 13 hours after that point in time.[%p]
In those 13 hours, I was to return Lukako to manhood.[%p]
I thought I had to change her back.[%p]
But now...[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin?”[%p]
A voice calls me back to the present.[%p]
There’s Mayuri, dragging her suitcase. Daru isn’t with her.[%p]
She’s probably upset.[%p]
After all, I completely stood her up on the promise we made this morning.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You came! But you’re late.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Mayushii was waiting...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I was really lonely...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sorry.”[%p]
I can’t look Mayuri in the eye.[%p]
As Mayuri was waiting in vain, I was making the worst possible decision for her.[%p]
I chose to not turn Lukako back.[%p]
I chose to not save Mayuri.[%p]
No, let’s not beat around the bush.[%p]
I chose to [color index="A0140000"]let her die.[color index="800000"][%p]
It’s not that I don’t want to save her. I do.[%p]
But I can’t bring myself to make the necessary sacrifice.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Where’s Luka-chan?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She’s not coming.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Did you make her cry again?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No...”[%p]
My thoughts are a jumble.[%p]
Her every word seems an accusation. Of course, I know that’s not her intent. Even if she knew what I had done, this innocent childhood friend of mine doesn’t have a bitter bone in her body.[%p]
It’s my guilty conscience, changing Mayuri’s words into swords stabbing straight through the heart.[%p]
But even so, I can no longer change the past. I don’t want to change it.[%p]
So I have no other choice.[%p]
No other choice but to accept the death this world so desires.[%p]
If I were a normal man, I would have had to accept Mayuri’s death whether I liked it or not. I wouldn’t have been able to try to avert it.[%p]
But by chance, I acquired the power of a god. It allowed me to try again and again. If anything, I should be grateful for the opportunity I was given.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin?”[%p]
I can’t let Mayuri sense my unease.[%p]
She can always tell when there’s something bothering me.[%p]
Ten minutes left.[%p]
I want her to spend them happy and carefree. That’s the very least I can do for her.[%p]
So I put on the mask of Hououin Kyouma, just as I did for Lukako.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“H-heheheh, muuhahaha! Fret not, Mayuri! Things between me and Lukako are absolutely marvelous!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“That miko and I are tied by a strong bond. That’s right, Lukako and I are connected by fate, whether we like it or not!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“And today I, the genius with an IQ of 170, have returned the smile to Lukako’s face.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“She even said so herself. That it was fun to be with me in our pursuit of knowledge!”[%p]
As soon as those words leave my lips, I realize my mistake.[%p]
That makes it sound like I broke my promise to Mayuri just so I could give Lukako a fun time, doesn’t it?[%p]
...Well, I suppose that is what happened.[%p]
But Mayuri didn’t need to know that.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Really? That’s great!”[%p]
But Mayuri, innocent as she is, just gives me a happy, relieved smile.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“So there’s no reason for Okarin and Luka-chan to break up, right?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Uh, right. We won’t break up.”[%p]
Actually, our temporary relationship has already ended.[%p]
That was our agreement.[%p]
But I don’t think I need to tell Mayuri that.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Great! Then Mayushii can concentrate on ComiMa without any worries!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Are you going to participate tomorrow too?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]”Yup! It lasts three whole days.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
I shouldn’t have asked.[%p]
I fight the urge to check my phone.[%p]
Last time I checked, it was about 7 PM.[%p]
I don’t have the guts to check again.[%p]
I don’t want to watch the seconds tick down to Mayuri’s death.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Daru-kun’s late...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I called him just now, and he said he was still close by.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We don’t really have to wait for him.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Let’s wait a little bit longer.”[%p]
If that’s what Mayuri wants, then I won’t deny her.[%p]
Besides, I don’t want Mayuri’s last moments to be on a crowded train or bus, but rather somewhere she can see the stars.[%p]
...Not that I have any right to choose her place of death.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Hey, do you think we can convince Luka-chan to cosplay somehow?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“How should we persuade her, though?”[%p]
Mayuri’s mood is completely healed.[%p]
Why is she so happy?[%p]
Did she hear something pleasing somewhere in this conversation?[%p]
Was it knowing that things are going well between me and Lukako?[%p]
Or was it that I kept my promise to come here after all?[%p]
I don’t know.[%p]
I don’t know, but seeing Mayuri’s happy smile makes my heart ache.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I think Luka-chan would be an absolutely perfect Kirari-chan cosplayer.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Luka-chan’s so cute, she makes Mayushii’s heart throb, you know.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“I want to spread Luka-chan’s cuteness to people all over the world. Don’t you, Okarin?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ah, or maybe you plan to keep Luka-chan all to yourself? But you know, you shouldn’t monopolize her. Even Mayushii wants to kyun-kyun with Luka-chan!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I don’t mind. It’s not like I can keep her all to myself.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ehehe! Yay♪”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Anyway, there’s one more reason I want to get Luka-chan to cosplay.”[%p]
Mayuri’s awfully obsessed with Lukako today.[%p]
Come to think of it, Mayuri has done nothing but talk about Lukako for these past four days, ever since Lukako and I started dating.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Luka-chan’s usually a quiet girl, right? She almost never says what she thinks.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“When you cosplay, you become someone other than yourself.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“That’s why I think that if Luka-chan cosplays once, she’ll definitely find a new Luka-chan, even if it’s embarrassing at first.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“And when that happens, she’ll become more assertive than before, and maybe even dominate you, Okarin! Ehehe!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
She really does care for Lukako.[%p]
And yet, I know that all of her hopes and dreams are in vain.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...”[%p]
Suddenly, Mayuri falls silent.[%p]
She looks up and raises one hand high above her head, as if to catch the stars twinkling in the night sky.[%p]
Stardust Handshake.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Can you see the stars?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Yeah.”[%p]
You can see the stars more clearly in Ariake than in Akiba.[%p]
If only the stars would answer her call.[%p]
If only she could melt into their embrace.[%p]
What salvation that would be.[%p]
In the past, when she has reached for the sky, I have always pulled her back down to earth, as if to keep her from floating away.[%p]
But today, I don’t dare.[%p]
What does Mayuri think about when she reaches for the starry sky?[%p]
I’ve never asked her.[%p]
Perhaps now is the time.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Hey, Mayuri--”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okarin! Mayu-shi!”[%p]
Daru runs up to us, calling our names.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Daru-kun! You’re late!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Haa, whew, my bad. Man, it took forever to check my spoils.”[%p]
Daru’s backpack is filled to the brim. He’s also carrying five paper bags illustrated with moe drawings. Such zeal.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ok, let’s go!”[%p]
Mayuri gets up to lead the way, and we start heading towards the train station.[%p]
The direct shuttle bus to Akiba has already ended its service.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It was so hot today, I thought I was gonna die! How was the cosplay?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“The breeze felt great!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Maybe you should cosplay next time.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“And when did you get here, Okarin? Buy anything?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Huh? Why so grim? You have a girlfriend like one of those filthy normals now. You’ve got no right to be depressed.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Okarin? Is something wro--”[%p]
Mayuri’s voice is abruptly cut short.[%p]
Her suitcase falls to the ground with a thud.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Ah, guh, uh...”[%p]
...It’s time.[%p]
Mayuri presses her hands to the center of her chest.[%p]
Her face contorts in pain.[%p]
I see it happen in slow motion, frame by frame.[%p]
Slowly, slowly.[%p]
She starts to fall.[%p]
It’s so sudden.[%p]
So sudden.[%p]
And so, I fail to catch her in time.[%p]
Mayuri falls to the ground, motionless.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Mayu-shi...?”[%p]
I can’t move.[%p]
I can’t breathe.[%p]
Strangely, I feel no sorrow.[%p]
All I feel is guilt.[%p]
I knew this would happen.[%p]
I could have prevented it.[%p]
The one who killed Mayuri... is me.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Mayu-shi! What’s wrong!?”[%p]
Daru tosses his bags away and runs to Mayuri’s side.[%p]
He lifts her up and slaps her cheeks a bit.[%p]
I keep watching, as if I were merely a bystander.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“She’s not breathing...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What is this... what the hell is this?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Okarin! There’s something wrong with Mayu-shi!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...She’s dead.”[%p]
What could be the cause?[%p]
A heart attack?[%p]
She wasn’t killed this time. That’s a relief.[%p]
At least Mayuri died in one piece.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Dead...? No way! We were just talking!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Hey, Mayu-shi! Wake up! Where’s the camera!? We’re on candid camera, right!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru.”[%p]
I put my hand on Daru’s shoulder to calm him down.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri’s dead.”[%p]
Daru turns pale.[%p]
His lips tremble as he looks at Mayuri’s face in disbelief.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Let’s call an ambulance.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Why did this happen...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“How can you be so calm!?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“She’s dead! She’s never coming back! Don’t you get it, Okarin!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...I get it.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“No, you don’t! She’s not breathing! See!?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I stood by... and let her die.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“What...?”[%p]
I kneel beside Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I couldn’t save you, Mayuri.”[%p]
I reach out to Mayuri’s motionless body.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No... I chose not to save you.”[%p]
I embrace her tightly. [%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I abandoned you, Mayuri.”[%p]
I look up to the starry sky, just as Mayuri always did.[%p]
The tears... don’t come.[%p]
Maybe I’ve gotten used to it.[%p]
Or maybe it’s because I’m not worthy to mourn her.[%p]
What fills my heart is emptiness.[%p]
