The warmth of Faris’s hand suddenly disappears from mine.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Wha...!?”[%p]
The summer sun fills my distorted vision.[%p]
Next comes the noise of Akiba -- the voices of the crowd and the theme songs of electronics shops.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“This is...”[%p]
Teleportation.[%p]
I realize I’m standing on Chuo-dori, right in front of Animate.[%p]
Animate!? The anime shop?[%p]
I scan the street.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“All the moe stores are back...”[%p]
The linea di universo must have changed.[%p]
That’s evident from the fact that Reading Steiner kicked in.[%p]
Faris, however, is nowhere to be seen.[%p]
Even though we were standing right next to each other just a moment ago, hand in hand. She disappeared.[%p]
Did her very existence disappear?[%p]
No, that’s absurd.[%p]
I refuse to accept that.[%p]
So, did our plan work? Or are things even worse now?[%p]
I need to explore this new linea di universo.[%p]
I head to the Tennouji residence and find Nae there, home alone.[%p]
I manage to convince her to let me in.[%p]
The divergence meter is there, as expected.[%p]
...What?[%p]
The first digit is blank.[%p]
It now reads “.275349%.”[%p]
Is it broken? Or is there a reason for the missing digit?[%p]
Anyway, better make a note of this number on my phone.[%p]
When I checked the divergence meter after erasing our memories with Suzuha, the number was above 0.4%. The current number is significantly lower now.[%p]
But the bigger question is that missing first digit.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Um... wh-who are you? What do you want?”[%p]
Nae peeks at me from behind the sliding door.[%p]
She’s acting even more afraid then usual.[%p]
I don’t want her to tattle on me to her dad. I’d better calm her down somehow.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Sorry for the sudden visit. I’m done.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“By the way, your old man’s the one who showed me how to get here.”[%p]
That doesn’t seem to ally her nervousness much. And she still doesn’t come any closer.[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“Who are you? Please, get out. If you don’t, I’ll call the police. And my daddy’s really, really strong.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...?”[%p]
What’s going on here?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Who am I? Come on. We’ve met any number of times.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“...?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I rent out the second floor of your old man’s shop. Remember?”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“H-help, Daddy!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Whoa! Now hold on a second.”[%p]
[name]Nae[line]“If you touch me, I’ll bite my tongue and die!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m not gonna touch you, okay? You really don’t remember me?”[%p]
Nae shakes her head frantically.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“We’ve never met?”[%p]
She nods.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Oh... sorry about that. I’m friends with your old man.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m done here, so I’ll be going now.”[%p]
My thoughts are a jumble, but I force a smile to hide my confusion and leave the Tennouji residence behind.[%p]
Something like this was bound to happen.[%p]
It’s a small comfort, but I knew the risks when I chose this path.[%p]
Given that canceling the Suzuha D-Mail only changed divergence by 0.07%, a change of 0.2% likely means a dramatic shift in the linea di universo, at least from my perspective.[%p]
It’s entirely possible that past events on this linea di universo -- my relationships included -- are very different from what I remember.[%p]
As proof...[%p]
...With the sole exception of Faris, all contacts have disappeared from my phone.[%p]
That’s nothing but pure horror to me.[%p]
To save Mayuri and Faris’s father, we warped the fabric of time even more than it had been warped already.[%p]
To lose everyone other than Faris...[%p]
That would be unbearable.[%p]
That can’t have happened. They can’t have disappeared. I’m sure they still exist.[%p]
My phone is just... broken is all. Yeah, that’s probably it.[%p]
I knew this might happen. I accepted the risks.[%p]
But at the same time, I don’t want my relationships with my friends to change.[%p]
I hold that desperate wish in my mind.[%p]
Mayuri, Daru, and Kurisu should be in the lab like usual.[%p]
Once I get there, Mayuri will greet me cheerfully. Right?[%p]
I climb the stairs to the second floor, praying that everything will be alright.[%p]
And there, I realize that my prayers were for naught.[%p]
The second floor is vacant.[%p]
And of course, the Macchina per il Salto Temporale is nowhere to be found.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“So MayQueen exists...”[%p]
Still in a daze, I wander to the maid cafe in search of a familiar face.[%p]
It feels like ten years since I last saw that cat logo.[%p]
I take a deep breath and open the door.[%p]
[name]Mayuri&Faris[line]“Welcome back, Myaster♪”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Faris... Mayuri...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Thank god...”[%p]
I feel indescribable relief when I see the two girls standing there.[%p]
They didn’t disappear. They still work here, just as I remember.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“No, Master! It’s Mayushii NyanNyan♪.”[%p]
Mayuri smiles at me and strikes a catlike pose.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“You’re Feris-chan’s Duel Partner, aren’t you?”[%p]
She turns to Faris.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Feris-chan, did you tell him Mayushii’s real name?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Hmmya? I don’t remember telling him, nya.”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“But you do call yourself Mayushii, so maybe he guessed, nya.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Oh! Ehehe!”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...?”[%p]
This feeling.[%p]
Something is very wrong.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma!”[%p]
Faris brings her mouth close to my ear.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Thanks for coming, nya. But please don’t act like my boyfriend in front of the customers, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Your... boyfriend?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Dummy! You can’t use that word, nya! We can sweet talk all we want after work’s over, so control yourself until then, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What are you talking about?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nyanya? Oh, I see. You get it, nya. You’re one cool cat, nya.”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“C’mon, Feris-chan! You can’t flirt with him here!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Nyahaha. What do you mean, Mayushii? I did no such thing, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Mayuri, do you remember Daru and Kurisu?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“...?”[%p]
Mayuri tilts her head with a confused expression.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Daru? Kurisu? Who?”[%p]
The coldness in the pit of my stomach returns.[%p]
There’s something odd about how Mayuri and Faris are acting.[%p]
Does this mean my relationship with them has changed as well?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Where’s our laboratory?”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Laboratory?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Love hotel?”[%p]
What the hell.[%p]
Faris grabs me by the ear.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ow. Ow! What are you doing!?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma! What’s this about, nya? Don’t tell me you made plans to meet Mayushii at a love hotel, nya?”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Kyouma’s such a pervert to think about doing immoral things with a minor like her, nya.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Laboratory, not love hotel! Don’t mix them up!”[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Laboratory? What do you mean by laboratory, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Laboratory. As in, the Laboratorio dei Gadget Futuristici...”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“You remember, don’t you, Mayuri? The Laboratorio dei Gadget Futuristici!”[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]“Um, Mayushii doesn’t know what that is. Sorry...”[%p]
She doesn’t remember... it can’t be.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“Anyway, why do you keep talking to Mayushii, nya? You trying to flirt right in front of your girlfriend, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“...”[%p]
Girlfriend? Faris? Whose?[%p]
Mine!?[%p]
[name]Faris[line]“If that’s how you’re gonna be, then I’m gonna have to ask you leave, nya. So what’ll it be, nya?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“R-right. Sorry...”[%p]
I apologize and ask to be seated.[%p]
And inside, I find Daru sitting at a table for two.[%p]
He’s fidgeting, for some reason.[%p]
Why is he staring at me like that?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Daru! There you are.”[%p]
I sit in front of Daru and let out a sigh of relief.[%p]
I drink my water in one gulp. I was really thirsty.[%p]
Daru doesn’t try to hide his displeasure.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Ehi, what’s your relationship to Faris-tan?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“What?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“I’ve seen you somewhere before. Where was it... Anyway, you’re being way too familiar with Faris-tan. Are you a filthy [color index="820000"]normal[color index="800000"]? You are, aren’t you?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Woah, Daru. Just what are you...”[%p]
I shut up as soon as I start talking.[%p]
Given how Mayuri and Faris are acting, it’s entirely possible that my relationship with Daru has changed too.[%p]
Better make sure.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Have we met before?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Course not. This is your first time here, right? As a regular customer, I make sure to remember the other customers’ faces.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“No, I’m pretty sure I count as a regular here.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“This taste... is the taste of a liar.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“How can you tell without even licking me?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Anyway, answer me. What’s your relationship to Faris-tan?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m...”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Not direct enough? Fine. Question one. What is your name?”[%p]
Why do I have to be cross-examined by Daru?[%p]
It’s unpleasant, but I also don’t want to anger him any more, so I’ll answer honestly.[%p]
The question is which name to use...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I’m... Hououin Kyouma.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Seriously!?”[%p]
Daru suddenly bends forward.[%p]
His attitude changes completely at this. He grabs my hand, suddenly happy to see me.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh, yeah! Yeah! Now I remember! I was sure I’d seen you somewhere before!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“You’re Faris-tan’s Duel Partner, Hououin-shi! Wow, I feel like an idiot!”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“It’s an honor to meet you! I’m a big fan of you and Faris-tan! I saw that last semifinal!”[%p]
He shakes my hand forcefully.[%p]
His hand is all sweaty.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Eh... ehi, wait, Daru...?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Daru? How do you know my nickname?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ah, well...”[%p]
The pieces are starting to fall into place.[%p]
The lab is gone.[%p]
Mayuri and Daru don’t know me.[%p]
We haven’t met.[%p]
We’re not friends.[%p]
We’re nothing.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“I... see...”[%p]
All the time we spent together is gone. Every moment. Every memory.[%p]
Is this the price I have to pay?[%p]
Is it my destiny to live in a world where even my best friends don’t know me?[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Man, tomorrow’s the finals, huh! Beat the shit outta those Viral Attackers for me.”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“The finals...?”[%p]
Viral Attackers... that means it’s about RaiNet AccessBattlers.[%p]
Am I participating as Faris’s partner?[%p]
But I thought the finals finished yesterday.[%p]
So on this linea di universo, it’s tomorrow?[%p]
I’ll ask Faris later.[%p]
For some reason, it looks like I’m her partner... and her boyfriend.[%p]
But I can deal with that later. Right now, there’s one more thing I need to know.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Ehi... do you know someone named Makise Kurisu?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Oh yeah, she’s that genius girl whose thesis got published in that big academic journal, right?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Have you met her?”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“She gave a lecture at ATF a couple weeks back. I saw it. She was pretty cute, hehehe.”[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]“Why do you ask?”[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]“Just wondering...”[%p]
It was obvious. If the lab doesn’t exist, then how could I have met Kurisu?[%p]
I go limp in my chair.[%p]
What about the bet I made? The bet to save Mayuri? Did I win or lose?[%p]
I should know by tonight.[%p]
If things go as scheduled, Mayuri will die.[%p]
Was it right to change the linea di universo?[%p]
And is Faris’s father still alive?[%p]
If we saved both of them, then I can accept the loss of my friends as the price.[%p]
I have no other choice.[%p]
